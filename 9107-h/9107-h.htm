    <h2>
      TO THE READER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In my seventy-fourth year, I have the satisfaction of seeing another work
      of my daughter brought before the public. This was more than I could have
      expected from my advanced age and declining health.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been reprehended by some of the public critics for the <i>notices</i>
      which I have annexed to my daughter's works. As I do not know their
      reasons for this reprehension, I cannot submit even to their respectable
      authority. I trust, however, the British public will sympathize with what
      a father feels for a daughter's literary success, particularly as this
      father and daughter have written various works in partnership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural and happy confidence reposed in me by my daughter puts it in
      my power to assure the public that she does not write negligently. I can
      assert that twice as many pages were written for these volumes as are now
      printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these tales, HARRINGTON, was occasioned by an extremely
      well-written letter, which Miss Edgeworth received from America, from a
      Jewish lady, complaining of the illiberality with which the Jewish nation
      had been treated in some of Miss Edgeworth's works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second tale, ORMOND, is the story of a young gentleman, who is in some
      respects the reverse of Vivian. The moral of this tale does not
      immediately appear, for the author has taken peculiar care that it should
      not obtrude itself upon the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public critics have found several faults with Miss Edgeworth's former
      works&mdash;she takes this opportunity of returning them sincere thanks
      for the candid and lenient manner in which her errors have been pointed
      out. In the present Tales she has probably fallen into many other faults,
      but she has endeavoured to avoid those for which she has been justly
      reproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, indulgent reader, I beg you to pardon this intrusion, and, with
      the most grateful acknowledgments, I bid you farewell for ever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I was a little boy of about six years old, I was standing with a
      maid-servant in the balcony of one of the upper rooms of my father's house
      in London&mdash;it was the evening of the first day that I had ever been
      in London, and my senses had been excited, and almost exhausted, by the
      vast variety of objects that were new to me. It was dusk, and I was
      growing sleepy, but my attention was awakened by a fresh wonder. As I
      stood peeping between the bars of the balcony, I saw star after star of
      light appear in quick succession, at a certain height and distance, and in
      a regular line, approaching nearer and nearer. I twitched the skirt of my
      maid's gown repeatedly, but she was talking to some acquaintance at the
      window of a neighbouring house, and she did not attend to me. I pressed my
      forehead more closely against the bars of the balcony, and strained my
      eyes more eagerly towards the object of my curiosity. Presently the figure
      of the lamp-lighter with his blazing torch in one hand, and his ladder in
      the other, became visible; and, with as much delight as philosopher ever
      enjoyed in discovering the cause of a new and grand phenomenon, I watched
      his operations. I saw him fix and mount his ladder with his little black
      pot swinging from his arm, and his red smoking torch waving with
      astonishing velocity, as he ran up and down the ladder. Just when he
      reached the ground, being then within a few yards of our house, his torch
      flared on the face and figure of an old man with a long white beard and a
      dark visage, who, holding a great bag slung over one shoulder, walked
      slowly on, repeating in a low, abrupt, mysterious tone, the cry of "Old
      clothes! Old clothes! Old clothes!" I could not understand the words he
      said, but as he looked up at our balcony he saw me&mdash;smiled&mdash;and
      I remember thinking that he had a good-natured countenance. The maid
      nodded to him; he stood still, and at the same instant she seized upon me,
      exclaiming, "Time for you to come off to bed, Master Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      I resisted, and, clinging to the rails, began kicking and roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't come quietly this minute, Master Harrington," said she,
      "I'll call to Simon the Jew there," pointing to him, "and he shall come up
      and carry you away in his great bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man's eyes were upon me; and to my fancy the look of his eyes and
      his whole face had changed in an instant. I was struck with terror&mdash;my
      hands let go their grasp&mdash;and I suffered myself to be carried off as
      quietly as my maid could desire. She hurried and huddled me into bed, bid
      me go to sleep, and ran down stairs. To sleep I could not go, but full of
      fear and curiosity I lay, pondering on the thoughts of Simon the Jew and
      his bag, who had come to carry me away in the height of my joys. His face
      with the light of the torch upon it appeared and vanished, and flitted
      before my eyes. The next morning, when daylight and courage returned, I
      asked my maid whether Simon the Jew was a good or a bad man? Observing the
      impression that had been made upon my mind, and foreseeing that the
      expedient, which she had thus found successful, might be advantageously
      repeated, she answered with oracular duplicity, "Simon the Jew is a good
      man for naughty boys." The threat of "Simon the Jew" was for some time
      afterwards used upon every occasion to reduce me to passive obedience; and
      when by frequent repetition this threat had lost somewhat of its power,
      she proceeded to tell me, in a mysterious tone, stories of Jews who had
      been known to steal poor children for the purpose of killing, crucifying,
      and sacrificing them at their secret feasts and midnight abominations. The
      less I understood, the more I believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all others, there was one story&mdash;horrible! most horrible!&mdash;which
      she used to tell at midnight, about a Jew who lived in Paris in a dark
      alley, and who professed to sell pork pies; but it was found out at last
      that the pies were not pork&mdash;they were made of the flesh of little
      children. His wife used to stand at the door of her den to watch for
      little children, and, as they were passing, would tempt them in with cakes
      and sweetmeats. There was a trap-door in the cellar, and the children were
      dragged down; and&mdash;Oh! how my blood ran cold when we came to the
      terrible trap-door. Were there, I asked, such things in London now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes! In dark narrow lanes there were Jews now living, and watching
      always for such little children as me; I should take care they did not
      catch me, whenever I was walking in the streets; and Fowler (that was my
      maid's name) added, "There was no knowing what they might do with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In our enlightened days, and in the present improved state of education,
      it may appear incredible that any nursery-maid could be so wicked as to
      relate, or any child of six years old so foolish as to credit, such tales;
      but I am speaking of what happened many years ago: nursery-maids and
      children, I believe, are very different now from what they were then; and
      in further proof of the progress of human knowledge and reason, we may
      recollect that many of these very stories of the Jews, which we now hold
      too preposterous for the infant and the nursery-maid to credit, were some
      centuries ago universally believed by the English nation, and had
      furnished more than one of our kings with pretexts for extortion and
      massacres.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to proceed with my story. The impression made on my imagination by
      these horrible tales was greater than my nursery-maid intended. Charmed by
      the effect she had produced, she was next afraid that I should bring her
      into disgrace with my mother, and she extorted from me a solemn promise
      that I would never tell any body the secret she had communicated. From
      that moment I became her slave, and her victim. I shudder when I look back
      to all I suffered during the eighteen months I was under her tyranny.
      Every night, the moment she and the candle left the room, I lay in an
      indescribable agony of terror; my head under the bed-clothes, my knees
      drawn up, in a cold perspiration. I saw faces around me grinning, glaring,
      receding, advancing, all turning at last into the same face of the Jew
      with the long beard and the terrible eyes; and that bag, in which I
      fancied were mangled limbs of children&mdash;it opened to receive me, or
      fell upon my bed, and lay heavy on my breast, so that I could neither stir
      nor scream; in short, it was one continued nightmare; there was no
      refreshing sleep for me till the hour when the candle returned and my
      tyrant&mdash;my protectress, as I thought her&mdash;came to bed. In due
      course she suffered in her turn; for I could not long endure this state,
      and, instead of submitting passively or lying speechless with terror, the
      moment she left the room at night I began to roar and scream till I
      brought my mother and half the house up to my bedside. "What could be the
      matter with the child?" Faithful to my promise, I never betrayed the
      secrets of my prison-house. Nothing could be learned from me but that "I
      was frightened," that "I could not go to sleep;" and this, indeed, my
      trembling condition, and convulsed countenance, sufficiently proved. My
      mother, who was passionately fond of me, became alarmed for my health, and
      ordered that Fowler should stay in the room with me every night till I
      should be quite fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Fowler sat beside my bed every night, singing, caressing, cajoling,
      hushing, conjuring me to sleep: and when in about an hour's time, she
      flattered herself that her conjurations had succeeded; when my relaxing
      muscles gave her hope that she might withdraw her arm unperceived; and
      when slowly and dexterously she had accomplished this, and, watching my
      eyelashes, and cautiously shading the candle with her hand, she had
      happily gained the door; some slipping of the lock, some creaking of the
      hinge, some parting sound startled me, and bounce I was upright in my bed,
      my eyes wide open, and my voice ready for a roar: so she was compelled
      instantly to return, to replace the candle full in my view, to sit down
      close beside the bed, and, with her arm once more thrown over me, she was
      forced again to repeat that the Jew's bag could not come there, and,
      cursing me in her heart, she recommenced her deceitful songs. She was
      seldom released in less than two hours. In vain she now tried by day to
      chase away the terrors of the night: to undo her own work was beyond her
      power. In vain she confessed that her threats were only to frighten me
      into being a good boy. In vain she told me that I was too old now to
      believe such nonsense. In vain she told me that Simon was only an
      old-clothes-man, that his cry was only "Old clothes! Old clothes!" which
      she mimicked to take off its terror; its terror was in that power of
      association which was beyond her skill to dissolve. In vain she explained
      to me that his bag held only my old shoes and her yellow petticoat. In
      vain she now offered to let me <i>see with my own eyes</i>. My imagination
      was by this time proof against ocular demonstration. One morning early,
      she took me down stairs into the housekeeper's room, where Simon and his
      bag were admitted; she emptied the bag in my presence, she laughed at my
      foolish fears, and I pretended to laugh, but my laugh was hysterical. No
      power could draw me within arm's-length of the bag or the Jew. He smiled
      and smoothed his features, and stroked his white beard, and, stooping low,
      stretched out his inoffensive hand to me; my maid placed sugared almonds
      on the palm of that hand, and bid me approach and eat. No! I stood fixed,
      and if the Jew approached, I ran back and hid my head in Fowler's lap. If
      she attempted to pull or push me forwards I screamed, and at length I sent
      forth a scream that wakened my mother&mdash;her bell rang, and she was
      told that it was only Master Harrington, who was afraid of poor Simon, the
      old-clothes-man. Summoned to the side of my mother's bed, I appeared
      nearly in hysterics&mdash;but still faithful to my promise, I did not
      betray my maid;&mdash;nothing could be learned from me but that I could
      not bear the sight of Old Simon the Jew. My mother blamed Fowler for
      taking me down to see such a sort of a person. The equivocating maid
      replied, that Master Harrington could not or would not be asy unless she
      did; and that indeed now it was impossible to know how to make him asy by
      day or by night; that she lost her natural rest with him; and that for her
      part she could not pretend to stand it much longer, unless she got her
      natural rest. Heaven knows <i>my</i> natural rest was gone! But, besides,
      she could not even get her cup of tea in an evening, or stir out for a
      mouthful of fresh air, now she was every night to sing Master Harrington
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but poetical justice that she who had begun by terrifying me, in
      order to get me to bed, and out of her way, should end by being forced to
      suffer some restraint to cure me of my terrors: but Fowler did not
      understand or relish poetical justice, or any kind of justice: besides,
      she had heard that Lady de Brantefield was in want of a nursery-maid for
      the little Lady Anne Mowbray, who was some years younger than Master
      Harrington, and Fowler humbly represented to my mother that she thought
      Master Harrington was really growing too stout and too much of a man; and
      she confessed quite above and beyond her management and comprehension; for
      she never pretended to any thing but the care of young children that had
      not arrived at the years of discretion; this she understood to be the case
      with the little Lady Anne Mowbray; therefore a recommendation to Lady de
      Brantefield would be very desirable, and, she hoped, but justice to her.
      The very desirable recommendation was given by my mother to Lady de
      Brantefield, who was her particular friend; nor was my mother in the least
      to blame on this occasion, for she truly thought she was doing nothing but
      justice; had it been otherwise, those who know how these things are
      usually managed, would, I trust, never think of blaming my mother for a <i>sort
      of thing</i> which they would do, and doubtless have done themselves
      without scruple, for a favourite maid, who is always a <i>faithful
      creature</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Fowler departed, happy, but I remained unhappy&mdash;not with her,
      departed my fears. After she was gone I made a sort of compromise with my
      conscience, and without absolutely breaking my promise, I made a half
      confession to my mother that I had somehow or other horrid notions about
      Jews; and that it was the terror I had conceived of Simon the Jew which
      prevented me from sleeping all night. My mother felt for me, and
      considered my case as no laughing matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was a woman of weak health, delicate nerves, and a kind of
      morbid sensibility; which I often heard her deplore as a misfortune, but
      which I observed every body about her admire as a grace. She lamented that
      her dear Harrington, her only son, should so much resemble her in this
      exquisite sensibility of the nervous system. But her physician, and he was
      a man who certainly knew better than she did, she confessed, for he was a
      man who really knew every thing, assured her that this was indisputably
      "the genuine temperament of genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon grew vain of my fears. My antipathy, my <i>natural</i>, positively
      natural antipathy to the sight or bare idea of a Jew, was talked of by
      ladies and by gentlemen; it was exhibited to all my mother's acquaintance,
      learned and unlearned; it was a medical, it was a metaphysical wonder, it
      was an <i>idiosyncrasy</i>, corporeal, or mental, or both; it was&mdash;in
      short, more nonsense was talked about it than I will repeat, though I
      perfectly remember it all; for the importance of which at this period I
      became to successive circles of visitors fixed every circumstance and
      almost every word indelibly in my memory. It was a pity that I was not
      born some years earlier or later, for I should have flourished a favourite
      pupil of Mesmer, the animal magnetizer, or I might at this day be a
      celebrated somnambulist. No, to do myself justice, I really had no
      intention to deceive, at least originally; but, as it often happens with
      those who begin by being dupes, I was in imminent danger of becoming a
      knave. How I escaped it, I do not well know. For here, a child scarce
      seven years old, I saw myself surrounded by grown-up wise people, who were
      accounting different ways for that, of which I alone knew the real,
      secret, simple cause. They were all, without my intending it, my dupes.
      Yet when I felt that I had them in my power, I did not deceive them much,
      not much more than I deceived myself. I never was guilty of deliberate
      imposture. I went no farther than affectation and exaggeration, which it
      was in such circumstances scarcely possible for me to avoid; for I really
      often did not know the difference between my own feelings, and the
      descriptions I heard given of what I felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for my integrity, my understanding, and my health, people
      began to grow tired of seeing and talking of Master Harrington. Some new
      wonder came into fashion; I think it was Jedediah Buxton, the man of
      prodigious memory, who could multiply in his head nine figures by nine;
      and who, the first time he was taken to the playhouse, counted all the
      steps of the dancers, and all the words uttered by Garrick in Richard the
      Third. After Jedediah Buxton, or about the same time, if I recollect
      rightly, came George Psalmanazar, from his Island of Formosa, who, with
      his pretended Dictionary of the Pormosan language, and the pounds of raw
      beef he devoured per day, excited the admiration and engrossed the
      attention of the Royal Society and of every curious and fashionable
      company in London: so that poor little I was forgotten, as though I had
      never been. My mother and myself were left to settle the affair with my
      nerves and the Jews, as we could. Between the effects of real fear, and
      the exaggerated expression of it to which I had been encouraged, I was now
      seriously ill. It is well known that persons have brought on fits by
      pretending to have them; and by yielding to feelings, at first slight and
      perfectly within the command of the will, have at last acquired habits
      beyond the power of their reason, or of their most strenuous voluntary
      exertion, to control. Such was my pitiable case; and at the moment I was
      most to be pitied, nobody pitied me. Even my mother, now she had nobody to
      talk to about me, grew tired of my illness. She was advised by her
      physician, on account of her own health, by no means to keep so close to
      the house as she had done of late: she went out therefore every night to
      refresh herself at crowded parties; and as soon as she left the house, the
      nurse and every body in the family left me. The servants settled it, in my
      hearing, that there was nothing in life the matter with me, that my mother
      and I were equally vapoursome-ish and <i>timersome</i>, and that there was
      no use in nursing and pampering of me up in them fantastical <i>fancifulnesses</i>:
      so the nurse, and lady's maid, and housekeeper, went down all together to
      <i>their</i> tea; and the housemaid, who was ordered by the housekeeper to
      stay with me, soon followed, charging the under housemaid to supply her
      place; who went off also in her turn, leaving me in charge of the cook's
      daughter, a child of nine years old, who soon stole out of the room, and
      scampered away along the gallery out of the reach of my voice, leaving the
      room to darkness and to me&mdash;and there I lay, in all the horrors of a
      low nervous fever, unpitied and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I be pardoned for having dwelt so long on this history of the mental
      and corporeal ills of my childhood? Such details will probably appear more
      trivial to the frivolous and ignorant than to the philosophic and well
      informed: not only because the best informed are usually the most
      indulgent judges, but because they will perceive some connexion between
      these apparently puerile details and subjects of higher importance. Bacon,
      and one who in later days has successfully followed him on this ground,
      point out as one of the most important subjects of human inquiry, equally
      necessary to the science of morals and of medicine, "The history of the
      power and influence of the imagination, not only upon the mind and body of
      the imaginant, but upon those of other people." This history, so much
      desired and so necessary, has been but little advanced. One reason for
      this may be, that both by the learned and the unlearned it is usually
      begun at the wrong end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Belier, mon ami, commences par le commencement</i>," is excellent
      advice; equally applicable to philosophical history and to fairy tale. We
      must be content to begin at the beginning, if we would learn the history
      of our own minds; we must condescend to be even as little children, if we
      would discover or recollect those small causes which early influence the
      imagination, and afterwards become strong habits, prejudices, and
      passions. In this point of view, if they might possibly tend to turn
      public attention in a new direction to an important subject, my puerile
      anecdotes may be permitted. These, my experiments, <i>solitary and in
      concert, touching fear</i>, and <i>of and concerning sympathies and
      antipathies</i>, are perhaps as well worth noting for future use, as some
      of those by which Sir Kenelm Digby and others astonished their own
      generation, and which they bequeathed to ungrateful posterity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My mother, who had a great, and perhaps not altogether a mistaken,
      opinion, of the sovereign efficacy of the touch of gold in certain cases,
      tried it repeatedly on the hand of the physician who attended me, and who,
      in consequence of this application, had promised my cure; but that not
      speedily taking place, and my mother, naturally impatient, beginning to
      doubt his skill, she determined to rely on her own. On Sir Kenelm Digby's
      principle of curing wounds, by anointing the weapon with which the wound
      had been inflicted, she resolved to try what could be done with the Jew,
      who had been the original cause of my malady, and to whose malignant
      influence its continuance might be reasonably ascribed; accordingly one
      evening, at the accustomed hour when Simon the old-clothes-man's cry was
      heard coming down the street, I being at that time seized with my usual
      fit of nerves, and my mother being at her toilette crowning herself with
      roses to go to a ball, she ordered the man to be summoned into the
      housekeeper's room, and, through the intervention of the housekeeper, the
      application was made on the Jew's hand; and it was finally agreed that the
      same should be renewed every twelvemonth, upon condition that he, the said
      Simon, should never more be seen or heard under our windows or in our
      square. My evening attack of nerves intermitted, as the signal for its
      coming on, ceased. For some time I slept quietly: it was but a short
      interval of peace. Simon, meanwhile, told his part of the story to his
      compeers, and the fame of his annuity ran through street and alley, and
      spread through the whole tribe of Israel. The bounty acted directly as an
      encouragement to ply the profitable trade, and "Old clothes! Old clothes!"
      was heard again punctually under my window; and another and another Jew,
      each more hideous than the former, succeeded in the walk. Jews I should
      not call them; though such they appeared to be at the time: we afterwards
      discovered that they were good Christian beggars, dressed up and daubed,
      for the purpose of looking as frightful, and as like the traditionary
      representations and vulgar notions of a malicious, revengeful, ominous
      looking Shylock as ever whetted his knife. The figures were well got up;
      the tone, accent, and action, suited to the parts to be played; the stage
      effect perfect, favoured as it was by the distance at which I saw and
      wished ever to keep such personages; and as money was given, by my
      mother's orders, to these people to send them away, they came the more. If
      I went out with a servant to walk, a Jew followed me; if I went in the
      carriage with my mother, a Jew was at the coach-door when I got in, or
      when I got out: or if we stopped but five minutes at a shop, while my
      mother went in, and I was left alone, a Jew's head was at the carriage
      window, at the side next me; if I moved to the other side, it was at the
      other side; if I pulled up the glass, which I never could do fast enough,
      the Jew's head was there opposite to me, fixed as in a frame; and if I
      called to the servants to drive it away, I was not much better off, for at
      a few paces' distance the figure would stand with his eyes fixed upon me;
      and, as if fascinated, though I hated to look at those eyes, for the life
      of me I could not turn mine away. The manner in which I was thus haunted
      and pursued wherever I went, seemed to my mother something "really
      extraordinary;" to myself, something magical and supernatural. The
      systematic roguery of beggars, their combinations, meetings, signals,
      disguises, transformations, and all the secret tricks of their trade of
      deception, were not at this time, as they have in modern days, been
      revealed to public view, and attested by indisputable evidence. Ignorance
      is always credulous. Much was then thought wonderful, nay, almost
      supernatural, which can now be explained and accounted for, by asy and
      very ignoble means. My father&mdash;for all this time, though I have never
      mentioned him, I had a father living&mdash;my father, being in public
      life, and much occupied with the affairs of the nation, had little leisure
      to attend to his family. A great deal went on in his house, without his
      knowing any thing about it. He had heard of my being ill and well, at
      different hours of the day; but had left it to the physicians and my
      mother to manage me till a certain age: but now I was nine years old, he
      said it was time I should be taken out of the hands of the women; so he
      inquired more particularly into my history, and, with mine, he heard the
      story of Simon and the Jews. My mother said she was glad my father's
      attention was at last awakened to this extraordinary business. She
      expatiated eloquently upon the medical, or, as she might call them,
      magical effects of sympathies and antipathies: on the nervous system; but
      my father was not at all addicted to a belief in magic, and he laughed at
      the whole <i>female</i> doctrine, as he called it, of sympathies and
      antipathies: so, declaring that they were all making fools of themselves,
      and a Miss Molly of his boy, he took the business up short with a high
      hand. There was some trick, some roguery in it. The Jews were all rascals,
      he knew, and he would soon <i>settle</i> them. So to work he set with the
      beadles, and the constables, and the overseers. The corporation of beggars
      were not, in those days, so well grounded in the theory and so alert in
      the practice of evasion as, by long experience, they have since become.
      The society had not then, as they have now, in a certain lane, their
      regular rendezvous, called the <i>Beggars' Opera</i>; they had not then,
      as they have now, in a certain cellar, an established school for teaching
      the art of scolding, kept by an old woman, herself an adept in the art;
      they had not even their regular nocturnal feasts, where they planned the
      operations of the next day's or the next week's campaign, so that they
      could not, as they now do, set at nought the beadle and the parish
      officers: the system of signals was not then perfected, and the means of
      conveying secret and swift intelligence, by telegraphic science, had not
      in those days been practised. The art of begging was then only art without
      science: the native genius of knavery unaided by method or discipline. The
      consequence was, that the beggars fled before my father's beadles,
      constables, and overseers; and they were dispersed through other parishes,
      or led into captivity to roundhouses, or consigned to places called
      asylums for the poor and indigent, or lodged in workhouses, or crammed
      into houses of industry or penitentiary houses, where, by my father's
      account of the matter, there was little industry and no penitence, and
      from whence the delinquents issued, after their seven days' captivity, as
      bad or worse than when they went in. Be that as it may, the essential
      point with my father was accomplished: they were got rid of that season,
      and before the next season he resolved that I should be out of the hands
      of the women, and safe at a public school, which he considered as a
      specific for all my complaints, and indeed for every disease of mind and
      body incident to childhood. It was the only thing, he said, to make a man
      of me. "There was Jack B&mdash;&mdash;, and Thomas D&mdash;&mdash;, and
      Dick C&mdash;&mdash;, sons of gentlemen in our county, and young Lord
      Mowbray to boot, all at school with Dr. Y&mdash;&mdash;, and what men they
      were already!" A respite of a few months was granted, in consideration of
      my small stature, and of my mother's all eloquent tears. Meantime my
      father took me more to himself; and, mixed with men, I acquired some
      manly, or what were called manly, ideas. My attention was awakened, and
      led to new things. I took more exercise and less medicine; and with my
      health and strength of body my strength of mind and courage increased. My
      father made me ashamed of that nervous sensibility of which I had before
      been vain. I was glad that the past should be past and forgotten; yet a
      painful reminiscence would come over my mind, whenever I heard or saw the
      word <i>Jew</i>. About this time I first became fond of reading, and I
      never saw the word in any page of any book which I happened to open,
      without immediately stopping to read the passage. And here I must observe,
      that not only in the old story books, where the Jews are as sure to be
      wicked as the bad fairies, or bad genii, or allegorical personifications
      of the devils, and the vices in the old emblems, mysteries, moralities,
      &amp;c.; but in almost every work of fiction, I found them represented as
      hateful beings; nay, even in modern tales of very late years, since I have
      come to man's estate, I have met with books by authors professing candour
      and toleration&mdash;books written expressly for the rising generation,
      called, if I mistake not, Moral Tales for Young People; and even in these,
      wherever the Jews are introduced, I find that they are invariably
      represented as beings of a mean, avaricious, unprincipled, treacherous
      character. Even the peculiarities of their persons, the errors of their
      foreign dialect and pronunciation, were mimicked and caricatured, as if to
      render them objects of perpetual derision and detestation. I am far from
      wishing to insinuate that such was the serious intention of these authors.
      I trust they will in future benefit by these hints. I simply state the
      effect which similar representations in the story books I read, when I was
      a child, produced on my mind. They certainly acted most powerfully and
      injuriously, strengthening the erroneous association of ideas I had
      accidentally formed, and confirming my childish prejudice by what I then
      thought the indisputable authority of <i>printed books</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time also I began to attend to conversation&mdash;to the
      conversation of gentlemen as well as of ladies; and I listened with a sort
      of personal interest and curiosity whenever Jews happened to be mentioned.
      I recollect hearing my father talk with horror of some young gentleman who
      had been <i>dealing with the Jews</i>, I asked what this meant, and was
      answered, "'Tis something very like dealing with the devil, my dear."
      Those who give a child a witty instead of a rational answer, do not know
      how dearly they often make the poor child pay for their jest. My father
      added, "It is certain, that when a man once goes to the Jews, he soon goes
      to the devil. So Harrington, my boy, I charge you at your peril, whatever
      else you do, keep out of the hands of the Jews&mdash;never go near the
      Jews: if once they catch hold of you, there's an end of you, my boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the reasons for the prudential part of this charge been given to me,
      and had the nature of the disgraceful transactions with the Hebrew nation
      been explained, it would have been full as useful to me, and rather more
      just to them. But this was little or no concern of my father's. With some
      practical skill in the management of the mind, but with short-sighted
      views as to its permanent benefit, and without an idea of its philosophic
      moral cultivation, he next undertook to cure me of the fears which he had
      contributed to create. He took opportunities of pointing out how poor, how
      helpless, how wretched they are; how they are abused continually, insulted
      daily, and mocked by the lowest of servants, or the least of children in
      our streets; their very name a by-word of reproach: "He is a Jew&mdash;an
      actual Jew," being the expression for avarice, hard-heartedness, and
      fraud. Of their frauds I was told innumerable stories. In short, the Jews
      were represented to me as the lowest, meanest, vilest of mankind, and a
      conversion of fear into contempt was partially effected in my mind;
      partially, I say, for the conversion was not complete; the two sentiments
      existed together, and by an experienced eye, could easily be detected and
      seen even one through the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now whoever knows any thing of the passions&mdash;and who is there who
      does not?&mdash;must be aware how readily fear and contempt run into the
      kindred feeling of hatred. It was about this time, just before I went to
      school, that something relative to the famous <i>Jew Bill</i> became the
      subject of vehement discussion at my father's table. My father was not
      only a member of parliament, but a man of some consequence with his party.
      He had usually been a staunch friend of government; but upon one occasion,
      when he first came into parliament, nine or ten years before the time of
      which I am now writing, in 1753 or 54, I think, he had voted against
      ministry upon this very bill for the Naturalization of the Jews in
      England. Government liberally desired that they should be naturalized, but
      there was a popular cry against it, and my father on this one occasion
      thought the voice of the people was right. After the bill had been carried
      half through, it was given up by ministry, the opposition to it proving so
      violent. My father was a great stickler for parliamentary consistency, and
      moreover he was of an obstinate temper. Ten years could make no change in
      his opinions, as he was proud to declare. There was at this time, during a
      recess of parliament, some intention among the London merchants to send
      addresses to government in favour of the Jews; and addresses were to be
      procured from the country. The county members, and among them of course my
      father, were written to; but he was furiously against <i>the
      naturalization</i>: he considered all who were for it as enemies to
      England; and, I believe, to religion. He hastened down to the country to
      take the sense of his constituents, or to impress them with his sense of
      the business. Previously to some intended county meeting, there were, I
      remember, various dinners of constituents at my father's, and attempts
      after dinner, over a bottle of wine, to convince them, that they were, or
      ought to be, of my father's opinion, and that they had better all join him
      in the toast of "The Jews are down, and keep 'em down."
    </p>
    <p>
      A subject apparently less liable to interest a child of my age could
      hardly be imagined; but from my peculiar associations it did attract my
      attention. I was curious to know what my father and all the gentlemen were
      saying about the Jews at these dinners, from which my mother and the
      ladies were excluded. I was eager to claim my privilege of marching into
      the dining-room after dinner, and taking my stand beside my father's
      elbow; and then I would gradually edge myself on, till I got possession of
      half his chair, and established a place for my elbow on the table. I
      remember one day sitting for an hour together, turning from one person to
      another as each spoke, incapable of comprehending their arguments, but
      fully understanding the vehemence of their tones, and sympathizing in the
      varying expression of passion; as to the rest, quite satisfied with making
      out which speaker was <i>for</i>, and which against the Jews. All those
      who were against them, I considered as my father's friends; all those who
      were <i>for</i> them, I called by a common misnomer, or metonymy of the
      passions, my father's enemies, because my father was their enemy. The
      feeling of party spirit, which is caught by children as quickly as it is
      revealed by men, now combined to strengthen still more and to exasperate
      my early prepossession. Astonished by the attention with which I had this
      day listened to all that seemed so unlikely to interest a boy of my age,
      my father, with a smile and a wink, and a side nod of his head, not meant,
      I suppose, for me to see, but which I noticed the more, pointed me out to
      the company, by whom it was unanimously agreed, that my attention was a
      proof of uncommon abilities, and an early decided taste for public
      business. Young Lord Mowbray, a boy two years older than myself, a gawkee
      schoolboy, was present; and had, during this long hour after dinner,
      manifested sundry symptoms of impatience, and made many vain efforts to
      get me out of the room. After cracking his nuts and his nut-shells, and
      thrice cracking the cracked&mdash;after suppressing the thick-coming yawns
      that at last could no longer be suppressed, he had risen, writhed,
      stretched, and had fairly taken himself out of the room. And now he just
      peeped in, to see if he could tempt me forth to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," cried my father, "you'll not get Harrington, he is too deep here
      in politics&mdash;but however, Harrington, my dear boy, 'tis not <i>the
      thing</i> for your young companion&mdash;go off and play with Mowbray: but
      stay, first, since you've been one among us so long, what have we been
      talking of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Jews, to be sure, papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," cried my father; "and what about them, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether they ought to be let to live in England, or any where."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right again, that is right in the main," cried my father; "though that is
      a larger view of the subject than we took."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what reasons did you hear?" said a gentleman in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reasons!" interrupted my father: "oh! sir, to call upon the boy for all
      the reasons he has heard&mdash;But you'll not pose him: speak up, speak
      up, Harrington, my boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've nothing to say about reasons, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! that was not a fair question," said my father; "but, my boy, you know
      on which side you are, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;on your side, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right&mdash;bravo! To know on which side one is, is one great
      point in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I can tell on which side every one here is." Then going round the
      table, I touched the shoulder of each of the company, saying, "A Jew!&mdash;No
      Jew!" and bursts of applause ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to my father again, he caught me in his arms, kissed me,
      patted my head, clapped me on the back, poured out a bumper of wine, bid
      me drink his toast, "No Naturalization Bill!&mdash;No Jews!" and while I
      blundered out the toast, and tossed off the bumper, my father pronounced
      me a clever fellow, "a spirited little devil, who, if I did but live to be
      a man, would be, he'd engage, an honour to my country, my family, and my
      <i>party</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Exalted, not to say intoxicated, by my father's praise, when I went to the
      drawing-room to the ladies, I became rather more eloquent and noisy than
      my mother thought quite becoming; she could not, indeed, forbear smiling
      furtively at my wit, when, in answer to some simple country lady's
      question of "After all, why should not the Jews be naturalized?" I, with
      all the pertness of ignorance, replied, "Why, ma'am, because the Jews are
      naturally an unnatural pack of people, and you can't naturalize what's
      naturally unnatural."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kisses and cake in abundance followed&mdash;but when the company was gone,
      my mamma thought it her duty to say a few words to me upon politeness, and
      a few words to my father upon the <i>too much</i> wine he had given me.
      The reproach to my father, being just, he could not endure; but instead of
      admitting the truth, he vowed, by Jupiter Ammon, that his boy should never
      be made a Miss Molly, and to school I should go, by Jupiter Ammon, next
      morning, plump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was well known in our house, that a sentence of my father's
      beginning and ending "<i>by Jupiter Ammon</i>" admitted of no reply from
      any mortal&mdash;it was the stamp of fate; no hope of any reversion of the
      decree: it seemed to bind even him who uttered the oath beyond his own
      power of revocation. My mother was convinced that even her intercession
      was vain; so she withdrew, weeping, to the female apartments, where,
      surrounded by her maids, the decree of fate was reported, but not
      verbatim, after the manner of the gods and goddesses. The maids and the
      washerwoman, however, scolded one another very much after their manner, in
      a council held at midnight, about my clothes; the result of the whole was
      that "they must be found and packed;" and found and packed at last they
      were; and the next morning, as decreed, early as Aurora streaked the east,
      to school I went, very little thinking of her rosy-tipped fingers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My life at school was like that of any other school-boy. I shall not
      record, even if I could remember, how often I was flogged when I did not
      deserve it, or how often I escaped when I did. Five years of my life
      passed away, of which I have nothing to relate but that I learned to whip
      a top, and to play at ball and marbles, each in their season; that I
      acquired in due course the usual quantity of Greek and Latin; and
      perpetrated in my time, I presume, the usual quantity of mischief. But in
      the fourth year of my schoolboy life, an opportunity for unusual mischief
      occurred. An accident happened, which, however trifling in itself, can
      never be effaced from my memory. Every particular connected with it, is
      indeed as fresh in my recollection as it was the day after it happened. It
      was a circumstance which awakened long dormant associations, and combined
      them with all the feelings and principles of party spirit, which had first
      been inculcated by my father at home, and which had been exercised so well
      and so continually by my companions at school, as to have become the
      governing power of my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schoolboys, as well as men, can find or make a party question, and quarrel
      out of any thing or out of nothing. There was a Scotch pedlar, who used to
      come every Thursday evening to our school to supply our various wants and
      fancies. The Scotch pedlar died, and two candidates offered to supply his
      place, an English lad of the name of Dutton, and a Jew boy of the name of
      Jacob. Dutton was son to a man who had lived as butler in Mowbray's
      family. Lord Mowbray knew the boy to be a rogue, but thought he was
      attached to the Mowbrays, and at all events was determined to support him,
      as being somehow supposed to be connected with his family. Reminding me of
      my early declaration at my father's table against the naturalization of
      the Jews, and the <i>bon-mot</i> I had made, and the toast I had drunk,
      and the pledge I had given, Mowbray easily engaged me to join him against
      the Jew boy; and a zealous partisan against Jacob I became, canvassing as
      if my life had depended upon this point. But in spite of all our zeal,
      noise, violence, and cabal, it was the least and the most simple child in
      the school who decided the election. This youngster had in secret offered
      to exchange a silver pencil-case for a top, or something of such
      inadequate value: Jacob, instead of taking advantage of the child,
      explained to him that his pencil-case was worth twenty tops. On the day of
      election, this little boy, mounted upon the top of a step-ladder, appeared
      over the heads of the crowd, and in a small clear voice, and with an
      eagerness which fixed attention, related the history of his pencil-case,
      and ended by hoping with all his heart that his friend Jacob, his honest
      Jacob, might be chosen. Jacob was elected. Mowbray and I, and all our
      party, vexed and mortified, became the more inveterate in our aversion to
      the successful candidate; and from this moment we determined to plague and
      persecute him, till we should force him to <i>give up</i>. Every Thursday
      evening, the moment he appeared in the school-room, or on the play-ground,
      our party commenced the attack upon "the Wandering Jew," as we called this
      poor pedlar; and with every opprobrious nickname, and every practical
      jest, that mischievous and incensed schoolboy zealots could devise, we
      persecuted and tortured him body and mind. We twanged at once a hundred
      Jew's-harps in his ear, and before his eyes we paraded the effigy of a
      Jew, dressed in a gabardine of rags and paper. In the passages through
      which he was to pass, we set stumbling-blocks in his way, we threw
      orange-peel in his path, and when he slipped or fell, we laughed him to
      scorn, and we triumphed over him the more, the more he was hurt, or the
      more his goods were injured. "We laughed at his losses, mocked at his
      gains, scorned his nation, thwarted his bargains, cooled his friends,
      heated his enemies&mdash;and what was our reason? he was a Jew."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was as unlike to Shylock as it is possible to conceive. Without one
      thought or look of malice or revenge, he stood before us Thursday after
      Thursday, enduring all that our barbarity was pleased to inflict; he stood
      patient and long-suffering, and even of this patience and resignation we
      made a jest, and a subject of fresh reproach and taunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I, who was not in other cases a cruel or an ill-natured boy, could be
      so inhuman to this poor, unprotected, unoffending creature I cannot
      conceive; but such in man or boy is the nature of persecution. At the time
      it all appeared to me quite natural and proper; a just and necessary war.
      The blame, if blame there were, was divided among so many, that the share
      of each, my share at least, appeared to me so small, as not to be worth a
      moment's consideration. The shame, if we had any, was carried away in the
      tide of popular enthusiasm, and drowned and lost in the fury and noise of
      the torrent. In looking back upon this disgraceful scene of our boyish
      days&mdash;boyish indeed I can scarcely call them, for I was almost, and
      Mowbray in his own opinion was quite, a man&mdash;I say, in looking hack
      upon this time, I have but one comfort. But I have <i>one</i>, and I will
      make the most of it: I think I should never have done so <i>much</i>
      wrong, had it not been for Mowbray. We were both horribly to blame; but
      though I was full as wrong in action, I flatter myself that I was wrong
      upon better or upon less bad motives. My aversion to the Jew, if more
      absurd and violent, was less interested and malignant than Mowbray's. I
      never could stand as he did to parley, and barter, and chaffer with him&mdash;if
      I had occasion to buy any thing, I was high and haughty, and at a word; he
      named his price, I questioned not, not I&mdash;down was thrown my money,
      my back was turned&mdash;and away! As for stooping to coax him as Mowbray
      would, when he had a point to gain, I could not have done it. To ask Jacob
      to lend me money, to beg him to give me more time to pay a debt, to cajole
      and bully him by turns, to call him alternately usurer and <i>my honest
      fellow</i>, extortioner and <i>my friend Jacob</i>&mdash;my tongue could
      not have uttered the words, my soul detested the thought; yet all this,
      and more, could Mowbray do, and did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mowbray was deeply in Jacob's debt, especially for two watches which
      he had taken upon trial, and which he had kept three months, making, every
      Thursday, some fresh excuse for not paying for them; at last Jacob said
      that he must have the money, that his employer could wait no longer, and
      that he should himself be thrown into prison. Mowbray said this was only a
      trick to work upon his compassion, and that the Jew might very well wait
      for his money, because he asked twice as much for the watches as they were
      worth. Jacob offered to leave the price to be named by any creditable
      watchmaker. Lord Mowbray swore that he was as good a judge as any
      watchmaker in Christendom. Without pretending to dispute that point, Jacob
      finished by declaring, that his distress was so urgent that he must appeal
      to some of the masters. "You little Jewish tell-tale, what do you mean by
      that pitiful threat? Appeal to the higher powers if you dare, and I'll
      make you repent it, you usurer! Only do, if you dare!" cried he, clenching
      his hand and opening it, so as to present, successively, the two ideas of
      a box on the ear, and a blow on the stomach. "That was logic and
      eloquence," added Mowbray, turning to me. "Some ancient philosopher, <i>you</i>
      know, or <i>I</i> know, has compared logic to the closed fist, and
      eloquence to the open palm. See what it is, Harrington, to make good use
      of one's learning."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all very clever, at least our party thought so, and at the moment
      I applauded with the rest, though in my secret soul I thought Jacob was
      ill used, and that he ought to have had justice, if he had not been a Jew.
      His fear of a prison proved to be no pretence, for it surmounted his dread
      of Mowbray's logic and eloquence, and of all the unpopularity which he was
      well aware must be the consequence of his applying to the higher powers.
      Jacob appealed, and Lord Mowbray was summoned to appear before the head
      master, and to answer to the charge. It was proved that the price set upon
      the two watches was perfectly fair, as a watchmaker, who was examined on
      this point, declared. The watches had been so damaged during the two
      months they had been in his lordship's possession, that Jacob declined
      taking them back. Lord Mowbray protested that they were good for nothing
      when he first had them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why did he not return them after the first week's trial, when Jacob
      had requested either to have them back or to be paid for them? His
      lordship had then, as half a dozen of the boys on the Jew's side were
      ready to testify, refused to return the watches, declaring they went very
      well, and that he would keep them as long as he pleased, and pay for them
      when he pleased, and no sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plain tale put down the Lord Mowbray. His wit and his party now
      availed him not; he was publicly reprimanded, and sentenced to pay Jacob
      for the watches in a week, or to be expelled from the school. Mowbray
      would have desired no better than to leave the school, but he knew that
      his mother would never consent to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother, the Countess de Brantefield, was a Countess in her own right,
      and had an estate in her own power;&mdash;his father, a simple commoner,
      was dead, his mother was his sole guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That mother of mine," said he to us, "would not hear of her son's being
      <i>turned out</i>&mdash;so I must set my head to work against the head of
      the head master, who is at this present moment inditing a letter to her
      ladyship, beginning, no doubt, with, '<i>I am sorry to be obliged to take
      up my pen</i>,' or, '<i>I am concerned to be under the necessity of
      sitting down to inform your ladyship</i>.' Now I must make haste and
      inform my lady mother of the truth with my own pen, which luckily is the
      pen of a ready writer. You will see," continued he, "how cleverly I will
      get myself out of the scrape with her. I know how to touch her up. There's
      a folio, at home, of old Manuscript Memoirs of the De Brantefield family,
      since the time of the flood, I believe: it's the only book my dear mother
      ever looks into; and she has often made me read it to her, till&mdash;no
      offence to my long line of ancestry&mdash;I cursed it and them; but now I
      bless it and them for supplying my happy memory with a case in point, that
      will just hit my mother's fancy, and, of course, obtain judgment in my
      favour. A case, in the reign of Richard the Second, between a Jew and my
      great, great, great, six times great grandfather, whom it is sufficient to
      name to have all the blood of all the De Brantefields up in arms for me
      against all the Jews that ever were born. So my little Jacob, I have you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray, accordingly, wrote to his mother what he called a <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>
      of a letter, and next post came an answer from Lady de Brantefield with
      the money to pay her son's debt, and, as desired and expected, a strong
      reproof to her son for his folly in ever dealing with a Jew. How could he
      possibly expect not to be cheated, as, by his own confession, it appeared
      he had been, grossly? It was the more extraordinary, since he so well
      recollected the ever to be lamented case of Sir Josseline de Brantefield,
      that her son could, with all his family experience, be, at this time of
      day, a dupe to one of a race branded by the public History of England, and
      private Memoirs of the De Brantefields, to all eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray showed this letter in triumph to all his party. It answered the
      double purpose of justifying his own bad opinion of the tribe of Israel,
      and of tormenting Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Thursday evening after that on which judgment had been given
      against Mowbray, when Jacob appeared in the school-room, the anti-Jewish
      party gathered round him, according to the instructions of their leader,
      who promised to show them some good sport at the Jew's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only give me fair play," said Mowbray, "and stick close, and don't let
      him off, for your lives don't let him break through you, till I've <i>roasted</i>
      him well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's your money," cried Mowbray, throwing down the money for the
      watches&mdash;"take it&mdash;ay, count it&mdash;every penny right&mdash;I've
      paid you by the day appointed; and, thank Heaven and my friends, the pound
      of flesh next my heart is safe from your knife, Shylock!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob made no reply, but he looked as if he felt much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tell me, honest Jacob," pursued Mowbray, "honest Jacob, patient
      Jacob, tell me, upon your honour, if you know what that word means&mdash;upon
      your conscience, if you ever heard of any such thing&mdash;don't you think
      yourself a most pitiful dog, to persist in coming here to be made game of
      for twopence? 'Tis wonderful how much your thoroughbred Jew will do and
      suffer for gain. We poor good Christians could never do as much now&mdash;could
      we any soul of us, think you, Jacob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Jacob, "I think you <i>could</i>, I think you <i>would."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud scornful laughter from our party interrupted him; he waited calmly
      till it was over, and then continued, "Every soul of you good Christians
      would, I think, do as much for a father, if he were in want and dying, as
      mine is." There was a silence for the moment: we were all, I believe,
      struck, or touched, except Mowbray, who, unembarrassed by feeling, went on
      with the same levity of tone as before: "A father in want! Are you sure
      now he is not a father of straw, Jacob, set up for the nonce, to move the
      compassion of the generous public? Well, I've little faith, but I've some
      charity&mdash;here's a halfpenny for your father, to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whilst I live, my father shall ask no charity, I hope," said the son,
      retreating from the insulting alms which Mowbray still proffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why now, Jacob, that's bad acting, out o' character, Jacob, my Jew; for
      when did any son of Israel, any one of your tribe, or your twelve tribes,
      despise a farthing they could get honestly or dishonestly? Now this is a
      halfpenny&mdash;a good halfpenny. Come, Jacob, take it&mdash;don't be too
      proud&mdash;pocket the affront&mdash;consider it's for your father, not
      for yourself&mdash;you said you'd do much for your father, Jacob."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob's countenance continued rigidly calm, except some little convulsive
      twitches about the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare him, Mowbray," whispered I, pulling back Mowbray's arm; "Jew as he
      is, you see he has some feeling about his father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jew as he is, and fool as you are, Harrington," replied Mowbray, aloud,
      "do you really believe that this hypocrite cares about his father,
      supposing he has one? Do <i>you</i> believe, boys, that a Jew pedlar <i>can</i>
      love a father gratis, as we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As we do!" repeated some of the boys: "Oh! no, for his father can't be as
      good as ours&mdash;he is a Jew!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jacob, is your father good to you?" said one of the little boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a good father, sir&mdash;cannot be a better father, sir," answered
      Jacob: the tears started into his eyes, but he got rid of them in an
      instant, before Mowbray saw them, I suppose, for he went on in the same
      insulting tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that he says? Does he say he has a good father? If he'd swear it,
      I would not believe him&mdash;a good father is too great a blessing for a
      Jew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! for shame, Mowbray!" said I. And "For shame! for shame, Mowbray!"
      echoed from the opposite, or, as Mowbray called it, from the Jewish party:
      they had by this time gathered in a circle at the outside of that which we
      had made round Jacob, and many had brought benches, and were mounted upon
      them, looking over our heads to see what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob was now putting the key in his box, which he had set down in the
      middle of the circle, and was preparing to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, stay, honest Jacob! tell us something more about this fine father;
      for example, what's his name, and what is he?" "I cannot tell you what he
      is, sir," replied Jacob, changing colour, "nor can I tell you his name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannot tell me the name of his own father! a precious fellow! Didn't I
      tell you 'twas a sham father? So now for the roasting I owe you, Mr. Jew."
      There was a large fire in the school-room; Mowbray, by a concerted
      movement between him and his friends, shoved the Jew close to the fire,
      and barricadoed him up, so that he could not escape, bidding him speak
      when he was too hot, and confess the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob was resolutely silent; he would not tell his father's name. He stood
      it, till I could stand it no longer, and I insisted upon Mowbray's letting
      him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not use a dog so," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dog, no! nor I; but this is a Jew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fellow-creature," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine discovery! And pray, Harrington, what has made you so
      tender-hearted all of a sudden for the Jews?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your being so hard-hearted, Mowbray," said I: "when you persecute and
      torture this poor fellow, how can I help speaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pray, sir," said Mowbray, "on <i>which</i> side are you speaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the side of humanity," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fudge! On <i>whose</i> side are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On yours, Mowbray, if you won't be a tyrant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>If!</i> If you have a mind to rat, rat <i>sans phrase</i>, and run
      over to the Jewish side. I always thought you were a Jew at heart,
      Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more a Jew than yourself, Mowbray, nor so much," said I, standing
      firm, and raising my voice, so that I could be heard by all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more a Jew than myself! pray how do you make that out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By being more of a Christian&mdash;by sticking more to the maxim 'Do as
      you would be done by.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a good maxim," said Jacob: a cheer from all sides supported me,
      as I advanced to liberate the Jew; but Mowbray, preventing me, leaped upon
      Jacob's box, and standing with his legs stretched out, Colossus-like,
      "Might makes right," said he, "all the world over. You're a mighty fine
      preacher, Master Harrington; let's see if you can preach me down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see if I can't <i>pull</i> you down!" cried I, springing forward:
      indignation giving me strength, I seized, and with one jerk pulled the
      Colossus forward and swung him to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done, Harrington!" resounded from all sides. Mowbray, the instant he
      recovered his feet, flew at me, furious for vengeance, dealing his blows
      with desperate celerity. He was far my overmatch in strength and size; but
      I stood up to him. Between the blows, I heard Jacob's voice in tones of
      supplication. When I had breath I called out to him, "Jacob! Escape!" And
      I heard the words, "Jacob! Jacob! Escape!" repeated near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, instead of escaping, he stood stock still, reiterating his prayer to
      be heard: at last he rushed between us&mdash;we paused&mdash;both parties
      called to us, insisting that we should hear what the Jew had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Lord&mdash;," said he, "and <i>dear</i> young gentleman," turning
      to me, "let poor Jacob be no more cause now, or ever, of quarrel between
      you. He shall trouble you never more. This is the last day, the last
      minute he will ever trouble you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. Looking round to all, twice to the upper circle, where his
      friends stood, he added, "Much obliged&mdash;for all kindness&mdash;grateful.
      Blessings!&mdash;Blessings on all!&mdash;and may&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more; but hastily taking up his box, he retired through
      the opening crowd. The door closed after him. Both parties stood silent
      for a moment, till Mowbray exclaimed, "Huzza! Dutton for ever! We've won
      the day. Dutton for Thursday! Huzza! Huzza! Adieu! Adieu!&mdash;<i>Wandering
      Jew!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one echoed his adieu or his huzzas. I never saw man or boy look more
      vexed and mortified. All further combat between us ceased, the boys one
      and all taking my part and insisting upon peace. The next day Mowbray
      offered to lay any wager that Jacob the Jew would appear again on the
      ensuing Thursday; and that he would tell his father's name, or at least
      come provided, as Mowbray stated it, with a name for his father. These
      wagers were taken up, and bets ran high on the subject. Thursday was
      anxiously expected&mdash;Thursday arrived, but no Jacob. The next Thursday
      came&mdash;another, and another&mdash;and no Jacob!
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was certain that poor Jacob would appear no more&mdash;and when
      his motive for resigning, and his words at taking leave were recollected&mdash;and
      when it became evident that his balls, and his tops, and his marbles, and
      his knives, had always been better and <i>more reasonable</i> than
      Dutton's, the tide of popularity ran high in his favour. <i>Poor Jacob</i>
      was loudly regretted; and as long as schoolboys could continue to think
      about the same thing, we continued conjecturing why it was that Jacob
      would not tell us his father's name. We made many attempts to trace him,
      and to discover his secret; but all our inquiries proved ineffectual: we
      could hear no more of Jacob, and our curiosity died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray, who was two or three years my senior, left school soon
      afterwards. We did not meet at the university; he went to Oxford, and I to
      Cambridge.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the mind is full of any one subject, that subject seems to recur with
      extraordinary frequency&mdash;it appears to pursue or to meet us at every
      turn: in every conversation that we hear, in every book we open, in every
      newspaper we take up, the reigning idea recurs; and then we are surprised,
      and exclaim at these wonderful coincidences. Probably such happen every
      day, but pass unobserved when the mind is not intent upon similar ideas,
      or excited by any strong analogous feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the learned Sir Thomas Browne was writing his Essay on the Gardens of
      Cyrus, his imagination was so possessed by the idea of a quincunx, that he
      is said to have seen a quincunx in every object in nature. In the same
      manner, after a Jew had once made an impression on my imagination, a Jew
      appeared wherever I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was on my road to Cambridge, travelling in a stagecoach, whilst we
      were slowly going up a steep hill, I looked out of the window, and saw a
      man sitting under a hawthorn-bush, reading very intently. There was a
      pedlar's box beside him; I thought I knew the box. I called out as we were
      passing, and asked the man, "What's the mile-stone?" He looked up. It was
      poor Jacob. The beams of the morning sun dazzled him; but he recognized me
      immediately, as I saw by the look of joy which instantly spread over his
      countenance. I jumped out of the carriage, saying that I would walk up the
      hill, and Jacob, putting his book in his pocket, took up his well-known
      box, and walked along with me. I began, not by asking any question about
      his father, though curiosity was not quite dead within me, but by
      observing that he was grown very studious since we parted; and I asked
      what book he had been reading so intently. He showed it to me; but I could
      make nothing of it, for it was German. He told me that it was the Life of
      the celebrated Mendelssohn, the Jew. I had never heard of this celebrated
      man. He said that if I had any curiosity about it, he could lend me a
      translation which he had in his pack; and with all the alacrity of
      good-will, he set down the box to look for the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't trouble yourself&mdash;don't open it," said I, putting my hand
      on the box. Instantly a smile, and a sigh, and a look of ineffable
      kindness and gratitude from Jacob, showed me that all the past rushed upon
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not trouble myself! Oh, Master Harrington," said he, "poor Jacob is not
      so ungrateful as that would come to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're only too grateful," said I; "but walk on&mdash;keep up with me,
      and tell me how your affairs are going on in the world, for I am much more
      interested about them than about the life of the celebrated Mendelssohn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is that possible! said his looks of genuine surprised simplicity. He
      thanked me, and told me that he was much better in the world than
      formerly; that a good friend of his, a London jeweller of his own tribe,
      who had employed him as a pedlar, and had been satisfied with his conduct,
      had assisted him through his difficulties. This was the last time he
      should go his rounds in England as a pedlar; he said he was going into
      another and a much better way of business. His friend, the London
      jeweller, had recommended him to his brother, a rich Israelite, who had a
      valuable store in Gibraltar, and who wanted a young man to assist him, on
      whom he could entirely depend. Jacob was going out to Gibraltar in the
      course of the next week. "And now, Mr. Harrington," said he, changing his
      tone and speaking with effort, as if he were conquering some inward
      feeling, "now it is all over, Mr. Harrington, and that I am leaving
      England, and perhaps may never see you again; I wish before I take leave
      of you, to tell you, sir, who my father was&mdash;<i>was</i>, for he is no
      more. I did not make a mystery of his name merely to excite curiosity, as
      some of the young gentlemen thought, nor because I was ashamed of my low
      birth. My father was Simon the old clothes-man. I knew you would start,
      Mr. Harrington, at hearing his name. I knew all that you suffered in your
      childhood about him, and I once heard you say to Lord Mowbray who was
      taunting you with something about <i>old Simon</i>, that you would not
      have that known, upon any account, to your school-fellows, for that they
      would plague you for ever. From that moment I was determined that <i>I</i>
      would never be the cause of recalling or publishing what would be so
      disagreeable to you. This was the reason why I persisted in refusing to
      tell my father's name, when Lord Mowbray pressed me so to declare it
      before all your school-fellows. And now, I hope," concluded he, "that Mr.
      Harrington will not hate poor Jacob, though he is the son of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused. I assured him of my regard: I assured him that I had long since
      got rid of all the foolish prejudices of my childhood. I thanked him for
      the kindness and generosity he had shown in bearing Mowbray's persecution
      for my sake, and in giving up his own situation, rather than say or do
      what might have exposed me to ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanking me again for taking, as he said, such a kind interest in the
      concerns of a poor Jew like him, he added, with tears in his eyes, that he
      wished he might some time see me again: that he should to the last day of
      his life remember me, and should pray for my health and happiness, and
      that he was sorry he had no way of showing me his gratitude. Again he
      recurred to his box, and would open it to show me the translation of
      Mendelssohn's Life; or, if that did not interest me, he begged of me to
      take my choice from among a few books he had with him; perhaps one of them
      might amuse me on my journey, for he knew I was a <i>reading young
      gentleman</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not refuse him. As he opened the packet of books, I saw one
      directed to Mr. Israel Lyons, Cambridge. I told Jacob that I was going to
      Cambridge. He said he should be there in a few days, for that he took
      Cambridge in his road; and he rejoiced that he should see me again. I gave
      him a direction to my college, and for his gratification, in truth, more
      than for my own, I borrowed the magazine containing the life of
      Mendelssohn, which he was so anxious to lend me. We had now reached the
      coach at the top of the hill; I got in, and saw Jacob trudging after me
      for some time; but, at the first turn of the road, I lost sight of him,
      and then, as my two companions in the coach were not very entertaining,
      one of them, a great fat man, being fast asleep and snoring, the other, a
      pale spare woman, being very sick and very cross, I betook myself to my
      magazine. I soon perceived why the life of Mendelssohn had so deeply
      interested poor Jacob. Mendelssohn was a Jew, born like himself in abject
      poverty, but, by perseverance, he made his way through incredible
      difficulties to the highest literary reputation among the most eminent men
      of his country and of his age; and obtained the name of the Jewish
      Socrates. In consequence of his early, intense, and misapplied application
      in his first Jewish school, he was seized at ten years old with some
      dreadful nervous disease; this interested me, and I went on with his
      history. Of his life I should probably have remembered nothing, except
      what related to the nervous disorder; but it so happened, that, soon after
      I had read this life, I had occasion to speak of it, and it was of
      considerable advantage in introducing me to good company at Cambridge. A
      few days after I arrived there, Jacob called on me: I returned his book,
      assuring him that it had interested me very much. "Then, sir," said he,
      "since you are so fond of learning and learned men, and so kind to the
      Jews, there is a countryman of mine now at Cambridge, whom it will be well
      worth your while to be acquainted with; and who, if I may be bold enough
      to say so, has been prepossessed in your favour, by hearing of your
      humanity to poor Jacob."
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched as I was by his eagerness to be of use to me, I could not help
      smiling at Jacob's simplicity and enthusiasm, when he proceeded to
      explain, that this person with whom he was so anxious to make me
      acquainted was a learned rabbi, who at this time taught Hebrew to several
      of the gownsmen of Cambridge. He was the son of a Polish Jew, who had
      written a Hebrew grammar, and was himself author of a treatise on fluxions
      (since presented to, and accepted by the university), and moreover the
      author of a celebrated work on botany. At the moment Jacob was speaking,
      certainly my fancy was bent on a phaeton and horses, rather than on Hebrew
      or fluxions, and the contrast was striking, between what he conceived my
      first objects at Cambridge would be, and what they really were. However, I
      thanked him for his good opinion, and promised to make myself acquainted
      with his learned countryman. To make the matter secure, as Jacob was to
      leave Cambridge the next day, and as the rabbi was at the house of one of
      his scholars in the country, and was not to return to Cambridge till the
      ensuing week, Jacob left with me a letter for him, and the very parcel
      which I had seen directed to Mr. Israel Lyons: these I engaged to deliver
      with my own hands. Jacob departed satisfied&mdash;happy in the hope that
      he had done me a service; and so in fact it proved. Every father, and
      every son, who has been at the university, knows how much depends upon the
      college companions with whom a young man first associates. There are
      usually two sets: if he should join the dissipated set, it is all over
      with him, he learns nothing; but if he should get into the set with whom
      science and literature are in fashion, he acquires knowledge, and a taste
      for knowledge; with all the ardour inspired by sympathy and emulation,
      with all the facility afforded by public libraries and public lectures&mdash;the
      collected and combined information of the living and the dead&mdash;he
      pursues his studies. He then fully enjoys the peculiar benefits of a
      university education, the union of many minds intent upon the same object,
      working, with all the advantages of the scientific division of labour, in
      a literary manufactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to deliver my packet to Mr. Lyons, I was surprised by seeing
      in him a man as different as possible from my preconceived notion of a
      Jewish rabbi; I never should have guessed him to be either a rabbi, or a
      Jew. I expected to have seen a man nearly as old as Methuselah, with a
      reverend beard, dirty and shabby, and with a blue pocket handkerchief.
      Instead of which I saw a gay looking man, of middle age, with quick
      sparkling black eyes, and altogether a person of modern appearance, both
      in dress and address. I thought I must have made a mistake, and presented
      my packet with some hesitation, reading aloud the direction to Mr. Israel
      Lyons&mdash;"I am the man, sir," said he; "our honest friend Jacob has
      described you so well, Mr. Harrington&mdash;<i>Mr. William Harrington
      Harrington</i> (you perceive that I am well informed)&mdash;that I feel as
      if I had had the pleasure of being acquainted with you for some time. I am
      very much obliged by this visit; I should have done myself the honour to
      wait upon you, but I returned only yesterday from the country, and my
      necessary engagements do not leave as much time for my pleasures as I
      could wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived by the tone of his address, that, though he was a Hebrew
      teacher, he was proud of showing himself to be a man of the world. I found
      him in the midst of his Hebrew scholars, and moreover with some of the
      best mathematicians, and some of the first literary men in Cambridge. I
      was awe-struck, and should have been utterly at a loss, had it not been
      for a print of Mendelssohn over the chimney-piece, which recalled to my
      mind the life of this great man; by the help of that I had happily some
      ideas in common with the learned Jew, and we; entered immediately into
      conversation, much to our mutual relief and delight. Dr. Johnson, in one
      of his letters, speaking of a first visit from a young gentleman who had
      been recommended to his acquaintance, says, that "the initiatory
      conversation of two strangers is seldom pleasing or instructive;" but I am
      sure that I was both pleased and instructed during this initiatory
      conversation, and Mr. Lyons did not appear to be oppressed or encumbered
      by my visit. I found by his conversation, that though he was the son of a
      great Hebrew grammarian, and himself a great Hebrew scholar, and though he
      had written a treatise on fluxions, and a work on botany, yet he was not a
      mere mathematician, a mere grammarian, or a mere botanist, nor yet a dull
      pedant. In despite of the assertion, that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "&mdash;&mdash;Hebrew roots are always found
    To flourish best on barren ground,"
</pre>
    <p>
      this Hebrew scholar was a man of a remarkably fertile genius. This visit
      determined my course, and decided me as to the society which I kept during
      the three happy and profitable years I afterwards spent at Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Israel Lyons is now no more. I hope it is no disrespect to his memory
      to say that he had his foibles. It was no secret among our contemporaries
      at Cambridge that he was like too many other men of genius, a little
      deficient in economy&mdash;shall I say it? a little extravagant. The
      difficulties into which he brought himself by his improvidence were,
      however, always to him matters of jest and raillery; and often, indeed,
      proved subjects of triumph, for he was sure to extricate himself, by some
      of his many talents, or by some of his many friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should be very sorry, however, to support the dangerous doctrine, that
      men of genius are privileged to have certain faults. I record with quite a
      different intention these <i>facts</i>, to mark the effect of
      circumstances in changing my own prepossessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faults of Israel Lyons were not of that species which I expected to
      find in a Jew. Perhaps he was aware that the Hebrew nation is in general
      supposed to be too <i>careful</i>, and he might, therefore, be a little
      vain of his own carelessness about money matters. Be this as it may, I
      confess that, at the time, I rather liked him the better for it. His
      disregard, on all occasions, of pecuniary interest, gave me a conviction
      of his liberal spirit. I was never fond of money, or remarkably careful of
      it myself; but I always kept out of debt; and my father gave me such a
      liberal allowance, that I had it in my power to assist a friend. Mr.
      Lyons' lively disposition and manners took off all that awe which I might
      have felt for his learning and genius. I may truly say, that these three
      years, which I spent at Cambridge, fixed my character, and the whole tone
      and colour of my future life. I do not pretend to say that I had not,
      during my time at the university, and afterwards in London, my follies and
      imprudences; but my soul did not, like many other souls of my
      acquaintance, "embody and embrute." When the time for my quitting
      Cambridge arrived, I went to take leave of my learned friend Mr. Israel
      Lyons, and to offer him my grateful acknowledgments. In the course of the
      conversation I mentioned the childish terror and aversion with which I had
      been early taught to look upon a Jew. I rejoiced that, even while a
      schoolboy, I had conquered this foolish prejudice; and that at the
      university, during those years which often decide our subsequent opinions
      in life, it had been my good fortune to become acquainted with one, whose
      superior abilities and kindness of disposition, had formed in my mind
      associations of quite an opposite nature. Pleased with this just tribute
      to his merit, and with the disposition I showed to think candidly of
      persons of his persuasion, Mr. Lyons wished to confirm me in these
      sentiments, and for this purpose gave me a letter of introduction to a
      friend, with whom he was in constant correspondence, Mr. Montenero, a
      Jewish gentleman born in Spain, who had early in life quitted that
      country, in consequence of his horror of tyranny and persecution. He had
      been fortunate enough to carry his wealth, which was very considerable,
      safely out of Spain, and had settled in America, where he had enjoyed
      perfect toleration and freedom of religious opinion; and as, according to
      Mr. Lyons' description of him, this Spanish Jew must, I thought, be a most
      accomplished and amiable person, I eagerly accepted the offered letter of
      introduction, and resolved that it should be my first business and
      pleasure, on arriving in London, to find and make myself acquainted with
      Mr. Montenero.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      People like myself, of lively imagination, may have often felt that change
      of place suddenly extinguishes, or gives a new direction to, the ardour of
      their enthusiasm. Such persons may, therefore, naturally suspect, that, as
      "my steps retired from Cam's smooth margin," my enthusiasm for my learned
      rabbi might gradually fade away; and that, on my arrival in London, I
      should forget my desire to become acquainted with the accomplished Spanish
      Jew. But it must be observed that, with my mother's warmth of imagination,
      I also had, I will not say, I inherited, some of my father's "<i>intensity
      of will</i>,"&mdash;some of that firmness of adhesion to a preconceived
      notion or purpose, which in a good cause is called resolution, in a bad
      cause obstinacy; and which is either a curse or a blessing to the
      possessor, according to the degree or habit of exercising the reasoning
      faculty with which he may be endowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my arrival in London, a variety of petty unforeseen obstacles occurred
      to prevent my accomplishing my visit to the Spanish Jew. New and
      never-ending demands upon my time arose, both in and out of my own family,
      so that there seemed a necessity for my spending every hour of the day and
      night in a manner wholly independent of my will. There seemed to be some
      fatality that set at nought all my previous plans and calculations. Every
      morning for a week after my arrival, I regularly put my letter of
      introduction to Mr. Montenero into my pocket, resolving that I would that
      day find him out, and pay my visit; but after walking all the morning, to
      bear and to forbear various engagements, to execute promised commissions,
      and to fulfil innumerable duties, I regularly came home as I went out,
      with my letter in my pocket, and with the sad conviction that it was
      utterly impossible to deliver it that day. These obstacles, and this
      contrariety of external circumstances, instead of bending my will, or
      making me give up my intention, fixed it more firmly in my mind, and
      strengthened my determination. Nor was I the least shaken from the settled
      purpose of my soul, by the perversity with which every one in our house
      opposed or contemned that purpose. One morning, when I had my letter and
      my hat in my hand, I met my father, who after looking at the direction of
      the letter, and hearing that I was going on a visit to a Spanish Jew,
      asked what business upon earth I could have with a Jew&mdash;cursed the
      whole race&mdash;rejoiced that he had five-and-twenty years ago voted
      against their naturalization in England, and ended as he began, by
      wondering what in the name of Heaven could make me scrape acquaintance
      with such fellows. When, in reply, I mentioned my friend, Mr. Israel
      Lyons, and the high character he had drawn of Mr. Montenero, my father
      laughed, saying that he would answer for it my friend Israel was not an
      Israelite without guile; for that was a description of Israelite he had
      never yet seen, and he had seen a confounded deal of the world. He decided
      that my accomplished Spanish Jew would prove an adventurer, and he advised
      me, a young man, heir to a good English fortune, to keep out of his
      foreign clutches: in short, he stuck to the advice he gave me, and only
      wished I would stick to the promise I gave him, when I was ten years old,
      to have <i>no dealings with the Jews</i>. It was in vain that I
      endeavoured to give my explanation of the word <i>dealings</i>. My
      father's temper, naturally positive, had, I observed, become, as he
      advanced in years, much more dogmatic and intolerant. I avoided
      contradicting his assertions; but I determined to pursue my own course in
      a matter where there could be nothing really wrong or improper. That
      morning, however, I must, I perceived, as in duty bound, sacrifice to my
      father; he took me under the arm, and carried me away to introduce me to
      some commonplace member of parliament, who, as he assured me, was a much
      fitter and more profitable acquaintance for me than any member of the
      synagogue could possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when, firm to my purpose, I was sallying forth, my
      mother, with a face of tender expostulation and alarm, stopped me, and
      entreated me to listen to her. My mother, whose health had always been
      delicate, had within these three last years fallen into what is called a
      very nervous state, and this, with her natural timidity and sensibility,
      inclined her now to a variety of superstitious feelings&mdash;to a belief
      in <i>presentiments</i> and presages, omens and dreams, added to her
      original belief in sympathies and antipathies. Some of these her
      peculiarities of opinion and feeling had perhaps, at first, only been
      assumed, or yielded to in her season of youth and beauty, to interest her
      admirers and to distinguish herself in society; but as age advanced, they
      had been confirmed by habit and weakness, so that what in the beginning
      might have been affectation, was in the end reality. She was alarmed, she
      said, by the series of strange coincidences which, from my earliest
      childhood, had occurred, seeming to connect my fate, in some extraordinary
      manner, with these Jews. She recalled all the circumstances of my illness
      when I was a child: she confessed that she had retained a sort of
      antipathy to the idea of a Jew&mdash;a weakness it might be&mdash;but she
      had had dreams and <i>presentiments</i>, and my fortune had been told her
      while I was at Cambridge; and some evil, she had been assured, hung over
      me within the five ensuing years&mdash;some evil connected with a Jew: in
      short, she did not absolutely believe in such prophecies, but still it was
      extraordinary that the first thing my mind should be intent upon, in
      coming to town, should be a Spanish Jew, and she earnestly wished that I
      would avoid rather than seek the connexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing my mother's turn for the romantic, I had anticipated her delight
      at the idea of making acquaintance with a noble-minded travelled Spaniard;
      but unluckily her imagination had galloped off in a contrary direction to
      mine, and now my only chance was to make her hear reason, and a very bad
      chance I knew this to be. I endeavoured to combat her <i>presentiment</i>,
      and to explain whatever appeared extraordinary in my love and hatred of
      the Jews, by recalling the slight and natural circumstances at school and
      the university, which had changed my early prejudice; and I laboured to
      show that no natural antipathy could have existed, since it had been
      completely conquered by humanity and reason; so that now I had formed what
      might rather appear a natural sympathy with the race of Israel. I laboured
      these points in vain. When I urged the literary advantages I had reaped
      from my friendship with Mr. Israel Lyons, she besought me not to talk of
      friendship with persons of that sort. I had now awakened another train of
      associations, all unfavourable to my views. My mother <i>wondered</i>&mdash;for
      both she and my father were great <i>wonderers</i>, as are all, whether
      high or low, who have lived only with one set of people&mdash;my mother
      wondered that, instead of seeking acquaintance in the city with old Jews
      and persons of whom nobody had ever heard, I could not find companions of
      my own age and rank in life: for instance, my schoolfellow and friend,
      Lord Mowbray, who was now in town, just returned from abroad, a fine young
      officer, "much admired here by the ladies, I can assure you, Harrington,"
      added my mother. This, as I had opportunity of seeing, was perfectly true;
      four, nearly five years had made a great apparent change in Mowbray for
      the better; his manners were formed; his air that of a man of fashion&mdash;a
      military man of fashion. He had served a campaign abroad, had been at the
      siege of Gibraltar, had much to say, and could say it well. We all know
      what astonishing metamorphoses are sometimes wrought even on the most
      hopeless subjects, by seeing something of the world, by serving a campaign
      or two. How many a light, empty shell of a young man comes home full, if
      not of sense, at least of something bearing the semblance of sense! How
      many a heavy lout, a dull son of earth, returns enlivened into a
      conversable being, who can tell at least of what it has seen, heard, and
      felt, if not understood; and who for years, perhaps for ever afterwards,
      by the help of telling of other countries, may pass in his own for a man
      of solid judgment! Such being the advantages to be derived by these means,
      even in the most desperate cases, we may imagine the great improvement
      produced in a young man of Lord Mowbray's abilities, and with his ambition
      both to please and to shine. In youth, and by youth, improvement in
      appearance and manner is easily mistaken for improvement in mind and
      principle. All that I had disliked in the schoolboy&mdash;the tyrannical
      disposition&mdash;the cruel temper&mdash;the insolent tone&mdash;had
      disappeared, and in their place I saw the deportment which distinguished a
      gentleman. Whatever remained of party spirit, so different from the
      wrangling, overbearing, mischievous party spirit of the boy, was in the
      man and the officer so happily blended with love of the service, and with
      <i>l'esprit de corps</i>, that it seemed to add a fresh grace, animation,
      and frankness to his manner. The evil spirit of persecution was dislodged
      from his soul, or laid asleep within him, and in its place appeared the
      conciliating spirit of politeness. He showed a desire to cultivate my
      friendship, which still more prepossessed me in his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray happened to call upon me soon after the conversation I had with my
      mother about the Spanish Jew. I had not been dissuaded from my purpose by
      her representations; but I had determined to pay my visit without saying
      any thing more about the matter, and to form my own judgment of the man. A
      new difficulty, however, occurred: my letter of introduction had
      disappeared. I searched my pockets, my portfolios, my letter-case, every
      conceivable place, but it was not to be found. Mowbray obligingly assisted
      me in this search; but after emptying half a dozen times over portfolios,
      pockets, and desks, I was ashamed to give him more trouble, and I gave up
      the letter as lost. When Mowbray heard that this letter, about which I was
      so anxious, was an introduction to a Jewish gentleman, he could not
      forbear rallying me a little, but in a very agreeable tone, upon the
      constancy of my Israelitish taste, and the perfect continuance of my
      identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left you, Harrington, and I find you, after four years' absence, intent
      upon a Jew; boy and man you are one and the same; and in your case, 'tis
      well that the boy and man should an individual make; but for my part, I am
      glad to change my identity, like all other mortals, once in seven years;
      and I hope you think I have changed for the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to think otherwise, especially at that moment. In a
      frank, open-hearted manner, he talked of his former tyrannical nature, and
      blamed himself for our schoolboy quarrel. I was charmed with him, and the
      more so, when he entered so warmly or so politely into my present
      distress, and sympathized with my madness of the moment. He suggested all
      that was possible to be done to supply the loss of the letter. Could not I
      get another in its stead? The same friend who gave me one letter of
      introduction could write another. No; Mr. Israel Lyons had left Cambridge,
      and I knew not where to direct to him. Could not I present myself to Mr.
      Montenero without a letter? That might be rather an awkward proceeding,
      but I was not to be stopped by any nice observances, now that I had set my
      mind upon the matter. Unluckily, however, I could by no means recollect
      the exact address of Mr. Montenero. I was puzzled among half a dozen
      different streets and numbers: Mowbray offered to walk with me, and we
      went to each of these streets, and to all the variety of numbers I
      suggested, but in vain; no Mr. Montenero was to be found. At last, tired
      and disappointed, as I was returning home, Mowbray said he thought he
      could console me for the loss of my chance of seeing my Spanish Jew, by
      introducing me to the most celebrated Jew that ever appeared in England.
      Then turning into a street near one of the play-houses, he knocked at the
      door of a house where Macklin the actor lodged. Lord Mowbray was well
      acquainted with him, and I was delighted to have an opportunity of seeing
      this celebrated man. He was at this time past the meridian of ordinary
      life, but he was in the zenith of his extraordinary course, and in the
      full splendour and vigour of his powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," said Mowbray, presenting me to Macklin, "is a young gentleman, who
      is ambitious of being acquainted with the most celebrated Jew that ever
      appeared in England. Allow me to introduce him to the real, original Jew
      of Venice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'This is the Jew
    That Shakspeare drew!'
</pre>
    <p>
      Whose lines are those, Harrington? do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Yours</i>, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine! you do me much honour: no, they are Mr. Pope's. Then you don't know
      the anecdote?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Pope, in the decline of life, was persuaded by Bolingbroke to go once
      more to the play-house, to see Mr. Macklin in the character of Shylock.
      According to the custom of the time, Pope was seated among the critics in
      the pit. He was so much struck and transported with admiration, that in
      the middle of the play, he started up, and repeated that distich.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, was not I right when I told you, Harrington, that I would introduce
      you to the most celebrated Jew in all England, in all Christendom, in the
      whole civilized world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one better than Mowbray knew the tone of enthusiastic theatric
      admiration in which the heroes of the stage like, or are supposed to like,
      to be addressed. Macklin, who was not asy to please, was pleased. The <i>lines</i>,
      or as Quin insisted upon their being called, the <i>cordage</i> of his
      face relaxed. He raised, turned, and settled his wig, in sign of
      satisfaction; then with a complacent smile gave me a little nod, and
      suffered Lord Mowbray to draw him out by degrees into a repetition of the
      history of his first attempt to play the character of Shylock. A play
      altered from Shakespeare's, and called "The Jew of Venice," had been for
      some time in vogue. In this play, the Jew had been represented, by the
      actors of the part, as a ludicrous and contemptible, rather than a
      detestable character; and when Macklin, recurring to Shakespeare's
      original Shylock, proposed, in the revived Merchant of Venice, to play the
      part in a serious style, he was scoffed at by the whole company of his
      brother actors, and it was with the utmost difficulty he could screw the
      manager's courage to the sticking-place, and prevail upon him to hazard
      the attempt. Take the account in Macklin's own words. [Footnote: Vide
      Macklin's Life.]
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the long expected night at last arrived, the house was crowded from
      top to bottom, with the first company in town. The two front rows of the
      pit, as usual, were full of critics. I eyed them," said Macklin, "I eyed
      them, sir, through the slit in the curtain, and was glad to see them
      there; as I wished, in such a cause, to be tried by a <i>special jury</i>.
      When I made my appearance in the green-room, dressed for the part, with my
      red hat on my head, my piqued beard, my loose black gown, and with a
      confidence which I had never before assumed, the performers all stared at
      one another, and evidently with a stare of disappointment. Well, sir,
      hitherto all was right, till the last bell rung; then, I confess, my heart
      began to beat a little: however, I mustered up all the courage I could,
      and recommending my cause to Providence, threw myself boldly on the stage,
      and was received by one of the loudest thunders of applause I ever before
      experienced. The opening scenes being rather tame and level, I could not
      expect much applause; but I found myself listened to: I could hear
      distinctly in the pit, the words '<i>Very well&mdash;very well indeed!
      this man seems to know what he is about</i>.' These encomiums warmed me,
      but did not overset me. I knew where I should have the pull, which was in
      the third act, and accordingly at this period I threw out all my fire; and
      as the contrasted passions of joy for the merchant's losses, and grief for
      the elopement of Jessica, open a fine field for an actor's powers, I had
      the good fortune to please beyond my most sanguine expectations. The whole
      house was in an uproar of applause; and I was obliged to pause between the
      speeches to give it vent, so as to be heard. The <i>trial scene</i> wound
      up the fulness of my reputation. Here I was well listened to, and here I
      made such a silent yet forcible impression on my audience, that I retired
      from this great attempt most perfectly satisfied. On my return to the
      green-room, after the play was over, it was crowded with nobility and
      critics, who all complimented me in the warmest and most unbounded manner;
      and the situation I felt myself in, I must confess, was one of the most
      flattering and intoxicating of my whole life. No money, no title, could
      purchase what I felt. By G&mdash;, sir, though I was not worth fifty
      pounds in the world at that time, yet let me tell you, I was <i>Charles
      the Great</i> for that night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis and enthusiasm with which Macklin spoke, pleased me&mdash;enthusiastic
      people are always well pleased with enthusiasm. My curiosity too was
      strongly excited to see him play Shylock. I returned home full of the Jew
      of Venice; but, nevertheless, not forgetting my Spanish Jew.&mdash;At
      last, my mother could no longer bear to see me perplex and vex myself in
      my fruitless search for the letter, and confessed that while we were
      talking the preceding day, finding that no arguments or persuasions of
      hers had had any effect, she had determined on what she called a pious
      fraud: so, while I was in the room&mdash;before my face&mdash;while I was
      walking up and down, holding forth in praise of my Jewish friend whom I
      did know, and my Jewish friend whom I did not know, she had taken up Mr.
      Israel Lyons' letter of introduction to Mr. Montenero, and had thrown it
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very much provoked; but to my mother, and a mother who was so fond
      of me, what could I say? After all, I confessed there was a good deal of
      fancy in the case on my side as well as on hers. I endeavoured to forget
      my disappointment. My imagination turned again to Shylock and Macklin;
      and, to please me, my mother promised to make a large party to go with me
      to see the Merchant of Venice the next night that Macklin should act; but,
      unfortunately, Macklin had just now quarrelled with the manager, and till
      this could be made up, there was no chance of his condescending to
      perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime my mother having, as she thought, fairly got rid of the Jews, and
      Mowbray having, as he said, cured me of my present fit of Jewish insanity,
      desired to introduce me to his mother and sister. They had now just come
      to town from the Priory&mdash;Brantefield Priory, an ancient family-seat,
      where, much to her daughter's discomfiture, Lady de Brantefield usually
      resided eight months of the year, because there she felt her dignity more
      safe from contact, and herself of more indisputable and unrivalled
      consequence, than in the midst of the jostling pretensions and modern
      innovations of the metropolis. At the Priory every thing attested,
      recorded, and flattered her pride of ancient and illustrious descent. In
      my childhood I had once been with my mother at the Priory, and I still
      retained a lively recollection of the antique wonders of the place.
      Foremost in my memory came an old picture, called "Sir Josseline going to
      the Holy Land," where Sir Josseline de Mowbray stood, in complete armour,
      pointing to a horrid figure of a prostrate Jew, on whose naked back an
      executioner, with uplifted whip, was prepared to inflict stripes for some
      shocking crime.&mdash;This picture had been painted in times when the
      proportions of the human figure were little attended to, and when
      foreshortening was not at all understood: this added to the horrible
      effect, for the executioner's arm and scourge were of tremendous size; Sir
      Josseline stood miraculously tall, and the Jew, crouching, supplicating,
      sprawling, was the most distorted squalid figure, eyes ever beheld, or
      imagination could conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having once beheld it, I could never bear to look upon it again, nor
      did I ever afterwards enter the tapestry chamber:&mdash;but there were
      some other of the antique rooms in which I delighted, and divers pieces of
      old furniture which I reverenced. There was an ancient bed, with scolloped
      tester, and tarnished quilt, in which Queen Elizabeth had slept; and a
      huge embroidered pincushion done by no hands, as you may guess, but those
      of the unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, who, during her captivity,
      certainly worked harder than ever queen worked before or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was an old, worm-eaten chair, in which John of Gaunt had sat;
      and I remember that while Lady de Brantefield expressed her just
      indignation against the worms, for having dared to attack this precious
      relique, I, kneeling to the chair, admired the curious fretwork, the dusty
      honeycombs, which these invisible little workmen had excavated. But John
      of Gaunt's chair was nothing to King John's table. There was a little
      black oak table, too, with broken legs, which was invaluable&mdash;for, as
      Lady de Brantefield confidently affirmed, King John of France, and the
      Black Prince, had sat and supped at it. I marvelled much in silence&mdash;for
      I had been sharply reproved for some observation I had unwittingly made on
      the littleness and crookedness of a dark, corner-chimneyed nook shown us
      for the banqueting-room; and I had fallen into complete disgrace for
      having called the winding staircases, leading to the turret-chambers, <i>back
      stairs.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Lady de Brantefield, the <i>touch-me-not</i> mistress of the mansion, I
      had retained a sublime, but not a beautiful idea&mdash;I now felt a desire
      to see her again, to verify my old notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Lady Anne Mowbray, who at the time I had been at the Priory, was a
      little child, some years younger than myself, I could recollect nothing,
      except that she wore a pink sash, of which she was very vain, and that she
      had been ushered into the drawing-room after dinner by Mrs. Fowler, at the
      sight of whom my inmost soul had recoiled. I remember, indeed, pitying her
      little ladyship for being under such dominion, and longing to ask her
      whether Fowler had told her the story of Simon the Jew. But I could never
      commune with Lady Anne; for either she was up in the nursery, or Fowler
      was at her back in the drawing-room, or little Lady Anne was sitting
      upright on her stool at her mother's feet, whom I did not care to
      approach, and in whose presence I seldom ventured to speak&mdash;consequently
      my curiosity on this point had, from that hour, slumbered within me; but
      it now wakened, upon my mother's proposing to present me to Lady Anne, and
      the pleasure of asking and the hope of obtaining an answer to my
      long-meditated question, was the chief gratification I promised myself
      from the renewal of our acquaintance with her ladyship.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My recollection of Lady de Brantefield proved wonderfully correct; she
      gave me back the image I had in my mind&mdash;a stiff, haughty-looking
      picture of a faded old beauty. Adhering religiously to the fashion of the
      times when she had been worshipped, she made it a point to wear the old
      head-dress exactly. She was in black, in a hoop of vast circumference, and
      she looked and moved as if her being Countess de Brantefield in her own
      right, and concentring in her person five baronies, ought to be for ever
      present to the memory of all mankind, as it was to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother presented me to her ladyship. The ceremony of introduction
      between a young gentleman and an old lady of those times, performed on his
      part with a low bow and look of profound deference, on hers, with back
      stepping-curtsy and bridled head, was very different from the nodding,
      bobbing trick of the present day. As soon as the <i>finale</i> of Lady de
      Brantefield's sentence, touching honour, happiness, and family connexion,
      would permit, I receded, and turned from the mother to the daughter,
      little Lady Anne Mowbray, a light fantastic figure, bedecked with "daisies
      pied," covered with a profusion of tiny French flowers, whose invisible
      wire stalks kept in perpetual motion as she turned her pretty head from
      side to side. Smiling, sighing, tittering, flirting with the officers
      round her, Lady Anne appeared, and seemed as if she delighted in
      appearing, as perfect a contrast as possible to her august and formidable
      mother. The daughter had seen the ill effect of the mother's haughty
      demeanour, and, mistaking reverse of wrong for right, had given reserve
      and dignity to the winds. Taught by the happy example of Colonel Topham,
      who preceded me, I learned that the low bow would have been here quite out
      of place. The sliding bow was for Lady Anne, and the way was to dash into
      nonsense with her directly, and full into the midst of nonsense I dashed.
      Though her ladyship's perfect accessibility seemed to promise prompt reply
      to any question that could be asked; yet the single one about which I felt
      any curiosity, I could not contrive to introduce during the first three
      hours I was in her ladyship's company. There was such a quantity of
      preliminary nonsense to get through, and so many previous questions to be
      disposed of: for example, I was first to decide which of three colours I
      preferred, all of them pronounced to be the <i>prettiest</i> in, the
      universe, <i>boue de Paris, oeil de l'empereur</i>, and a <i>suppressed
      sigh</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, Lady Anne wore the <i>suppressed sigh</i>, but I did not
      know it&mdash;I mistook it for <i>boue de Paris</i>&mdash;conceive my
      ignorance! No two things in nature, not a horse-chestnut and a
      chestnut-horse, could be more different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive my confusion! and Colonels Topham and Beauclerk standing by. But
      I recovered myself in public opinion, by admiring the slipper on her
      ladyship's little foot. Now I showed my taste, for this slipper had but
      the night before arrived express from Paris, and it was called a <i>venez-y
      voir</i>; and how a slipper, with a heel so high, and a quarter so low,
      could be kept on the foot, or how the fair could walk in it, I could not
      conceive, except by the special care of her guardian sylph.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the <i>venez-y voir</i> had fixed all eyes as desired, the lady
      turning alternately to Colonels Topham and Beauclerk, with rapid gestures
      of ecstasy, exclaimed, "The <i>pouf!</i> the <i>pouf!</i> Oh! on Wednesday
      I shall have the <i>pouf</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what manner of thing a <i>pouf!</i> might be, I had not the slightest
      conception. "It requireth," said Bacon, "great cunning for a man in
      discourse to seem to know that which he knoweth not." Warned by <i>boue de
      Paris</i> and the <i>suppressed sigh</i>, this time I found safety in
      silence. I listened, and learned, first that <i>un pouf</i> was the most
      charming thing in the creation; next, that nobody upon earth could be seen
      in Paris without one; that one was coming from Mademoiselle Berlin, per
      favour of Miss Wilkes, for Lady Anne Mowbray, and that it would be on her
      head on Wednesday; and Colonel Topham swore there would be no resisting
      her ladyship in the <i>pouf</i>, she would look so killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So killing," was the colonel's last.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now thought that I had Lady Anne's ear to myself; but she ran on to
      something else, and I was forced to follow as she skimmed over fields of
      nonsense. At last she did stop to take breath, and I did get in my one
      question: to which her ladyship replied, "Poor Fowler frighten me? Lord!
      No. Like her? oh! yes&mdash;dote upon Fowler! didn't you?&mdash;No, you
      hated her, I remember. Well, but I assure you she's the best creature in
      the world; I could always make her do just what I pleased. Positively, I
      must make you make it up with her, if I can remember it, when she comes up
      to town&mdash;she is to come up for my birthday. Mamma, you know,
      generally leaves her at the Priory, to take care of all the old trumpery,
      and show the place&mdash;you know it's a <i>show place</i>. But I tell
      Colonel Topham, when I've a place of my own, I positively will have it
      modern, and all the furniture in the very newest style. I'm so sick of old
      reliques! Natural, you know, when <i>I have been having</i> a surfeit all
      my life of old beds and chairs, and John of Gaunt and the Black Prince.
      But the Black Prince, I remember, was always a vast favourite of yours.
      Well, but poor Fowler, you must like her, too&mdash;I assure you she
      always speaks with tenderness of you; she is really the best old soul! for
      she's growing oldish, but so faithful, and so sincere too. Only flatters
      mamma sometimes so, I can hardly help laughing in her face; but then you
      know mamma, and old ladies, when they come to that pass, must be flattered
      to keep them up&mdash;'tis but charitable&mdash;really right. Poor
      Fowler's daughter is to be my maid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know Fowler had a daughter, and a daughter grown up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nancy Fowler! not know! Oh! yes, quite grown up, fit to be married&mdash;only
      a year younger than I am. And there's our old apothecary in the country
      has taken such a fancy to her! But he's too old and <i>wiggy</i>&mdash;but
      it would make a sort of lady of her, and her mother will have it so&mdash;but
      she sha'n't&mdash;I've no notion of compulsion. Nancy shall be my maid,
      for she is quite out of the common style; can copy verses for one&mdash;I've
      no time, you know&mdash;and draws patterns in a minute. I declare I don't
      know which I love best&mdash;Fowler or Nancy&mdash;poor old Fowler, I
      think. Do you know she says I'm so like the print of the Queen of France.
      It never struck me; but I'll go and ask Topham."
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that Fowler, wiser grown, had learned how much more secure the
      reign of flattery is, than the reign of terror. She was now, as I found,
      supreme in the favour of both her young and old lady. The specimen I have
      given of Lady Anne Mowbray's conversation, or rather of Lady Anne's mode
      of talking, will, I fancy, be amply sufficient to satiate all curiosity
      concerning her ladyship's understanding and character. She had, indeed,
      like most of the young ladies her companions&mdash;"no character at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Female conversation in general was, at this time, very different from what
      it is in our happier days. A few bright stars had risen, and shone, and
      been admired; but the useful light had not diffused itself. Miss Talbot's
      and Miss Carter's learning and piety, Mrs. Montague's genius, Mrs. Vesey's
      elegance, and Mrs. Boscawen's [Footnote: See Bas-Bleu.] "polished ease,"
      had brought female literature into fashion in certain favoured circles;
      but it had not, as it has now, become general in almost every rank of
      life. Young ladies had, it is true, got beyond the Spectator and the
      Guardian: Richardson's novels had done much towards opening a larger field
      of discussion. One of Miss Burney's excellent novels had appeared, and had
      made an era in London conversation; but still it was rather venturing out
      of the safe course for a young lady to talk of books, even of novels; it
      was not, as it is now, expected that she should know what is going on in
      the literary world. The Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews, and varieties of
      literary and scientific journals, had not
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way."
</pre>
    <p>
      Before there was a regular demand and an established market, there were
      certain hawkers and pedlars of literature, fetchers and carriers of bays,
      and at every turn copies of impromptus, charades, and lines by the
      honourable Miss C&mdash;&mdash;, and the honourable Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;,
      were put into my hands by young ladies, begging for praise, which it was
      seldom in my power conscientiously to bestow. I early had a foreboding&mdash;one
      of my mother's <i>presentiments</i>&mdash;that I should come to disgrace
      with Lady Anne Mowbray about some of these cursed scraps of poetry. Her
      ladyship had one&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;<i>peculiarity</i>. She could
      not bear that any one should differ from her in matters of taste; and
      though she regularly disclaimed being a reading lady, she was most assured
      of what she was most ignorant. With the assistance of Fowler's flattery,
      together with that of all the hangers-on at Brantefield Priory, her temper
      had been rendered incapable of bearing contradiction. But this defect was
      not immediately apparent: on the contrary, Lady Anne was generally thought
      a pleasant, good-humoured creature, and most people wondered that the
      daughter could be so different from the mother. Lady de Brantefield was
      universally known to be positive and prejudiced. Her prejudices were all
      old-fashioned, and ran directly counter to the habits of her acquaintance.
      Lady Anne's, on the contrary, were all in favour of the present fashion,
      whatever it might be, and ran smoothly with the popular stream. The
      violence of her temper could, therefore, scarcely be suspected, till
      something opposed the current: a small obstacle would then do the business&mdash;would
      raise the stream suddenly to a surprising height, and would produce a
      tremendous noise. It was my ill fortune one unlucky day to cross Lady Anne
      Mowbray's humour, and to oppose her opinion. It was about a trifle; but
      trifles, indeed, made, with her, the sum of human things. She came one
      morning, as it was her custom, to loiter away her time at my mother's till
      the proper hour for going out to visit. For five minutes she sat at some
      fashionable kind of work&mdash;<i>wafer work</i>, I think it was called, a
      work which has been long since consigned to the mice; then her ladyship
      yawned, and exclaiming, "Oh, those lines of Lord Chesterfield's, which
      Colonel Topham gave me; I'll copy them into my album. Where's my <i>album</i>?&mdash;Mrs.
      Harrington, I lent it to you. Oh! here it is. Mr. Harrington, you will
      finish copying this for me." So I was set down to the <i>album</i> to copy&mdash;<i>Advice
      to a Lady in Autumn</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Asses' milk, half a pint, take at seven, or before."
</pre>
    <p>
      My mother, who saw that I did not relish the asses' milk, put in a word
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lady Anne, it is not worth while to write these lines in your <i>album</i>,
      for they were in print long ago, in every lady's old memorandum-book, and
      in Dodsley's Collection, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still that was quite a different thing," Lady Anne said, "from having
      them in her <i>album</i>; so Mr. Harrington must be so very good." I did
      not understand the particular use of copying in my illegible hand what
      could be so much better read in print; but it was all-sufficient that her
      ladyship chose it. When I had copied the verses I must, Lady Anne said,
      read the lines, and admire them. But I had read them twenty times before,
      and I could not say that they were as fresh the twentieth reading as at
      the first. Lord Mowbray came in, and she ran to her brother:&mdash;"Mowbray!
      can any thing in nature be prettier than these verses of Lord
      Chesterfield? Mowbray, you, who are a judge, listen to these two lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'The dews of the evening moat carefully shun,
    Those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun.'
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Now</i>, here's your friend, Mr. Harrington, says it's only a <i>prettiness</i>,
      and something about Ovid. I'm sure I wish you'd advise some of your
      friends to leave their classics, as you did, at the musty university. What
      have we to do with Ovid in London? You, yourself, Mr. Harrington, who set
      up for such a critic, what fault can you find, pray, with
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Keep all cold from your breast, there's already too much?'"
</pre>
    <p>
      By the lady's tone of voice, raised complexion, and whole air of the head,
      I saw the danger was imminent, and to avoid the coming storm, I sheltered
      myself under the cover of modesty; but Mowbray dragged me out to make
      sport for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Harrington, that will never do. No critic! No judge! You! with all
      your college honours fresh about you. Come, come, Harrington, pronounce
      you must. Is this poetry or not?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    '<i>Keep all cold from your breast, there's already too much</i>.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Whether prose or poetry, I pronounce it to be very good advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good advice! the thing of all others I have the most detested from my
      childhood," cried Lady Anne; "but I insist upon it, it is good poetry, Mr.
      Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And equally good grammar, and good English, and good sense," cried her
      brother, in an ironical tone. "Come, Harrington, acknowledge it all, man&mdash;all
      equally. Never stop half way, when a young&mdash;and such a young lady,
      summons you to surrender to her your truth, taste, and common sense. Gi'
      her a' the plea, or you'll get na good of a woman's hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, sir!&mdash;So, my lord, you are against me too, and you are mocking
      me too, I find. I humbly thank you, gentlemen," cried Lady Anne, in a high
      tone of disdain; "from a colonel in the army, and a nobleman who has been
      on the continent, I might have expected more politeness. From a Cambridge
      scholar no wonder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother laid down her netting in the middle of a row, and came to keep
      the peace. But it was too late; Lady Anne was deaf and blind with passion.
      She confessed she could not see of what use either of the universities
      were in this world, except to make bears and bores of young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship, fluent in anger beyond conception, poured, as she turned
      from her brother to me, and from me to her brother, a flood of nonsense,
      which, when it had once broken bounds, there was no restraining in its
      course. Amazed at the torrent, my mother stood aghast; Mowbray burst into
      unextinguishable laughter: I preserved my gravity as long as I possibly
      could; I felt the risible infection seizing me, and that malicious
      Mowbray, just when he saw me in the struggle&mdash;the agony&mdash;sent me
      back such an image of my own length of face, that there was no
      withstanding it. I, too, breaking all bounds of decorum, gave way to
      visible and audible laughter; and from which I was first recovered by
      seeing the lady burst into tears, and by hearing, at the same moment, my
      mother pronounce in a tone of grave displeasure, "Very ill-bred,
      Harrington!" My mother's tone of displeasure affecting me much more than
      the young lady's tears, I hastened to beg pardon, and I humbled myself
      before Lady Anne; but she spurned me, and Mowbray laughed the more.
      Mowbray, I believe, really wished that I should like his sister; yet he
      could not refrain from indulging his taste for ridicule, even at her
      expense. My mother wondered how Lord Mowbray could tease his sister in
      such a manner; and as for Harrington, she really thought he had known that
      the first law of good-breeding is never to say or do any thing that can
      hurt another person's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never <i>intentionally</i> to hurt another's feelings, ma'am," said I; "I
      hope you will allow me to plead the innocence of my intentions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! there was no malicious <i>intent</i>: Not guilty&mdash;Not
      guilty!" cried Mowbray. "Anne, you acquit him there, don't you, Anne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne sobbed, but spoke not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is little consolation, and no compensation, to the person who is
      hurt," said my mother, "that the offender pleads he did not mean to say or
      do any thing rude: a rude thing is a rude thing&mdash;the intention is
      nothing&mdash;all we are to judge of is the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but after all, in fact," said Mowbray, "there was nothing to make
      any body seriously angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that every body's own feelings must be the best judge," said my
      mother, "the best and the sole judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven! that is not the law of libel <i>yet</i>, not the law of the
      land <i>yet</i>," said Mowbray; "no knowing what we may come to. Would it
      not be hard, ma'am, to constitute the feelings of one person <i>always</i>
      sole judge of the intentions of another? though in cases like the present
      I submit. Let it be a ruled case, that the sensibility of a lady shall be
      the measure of a gentleman's guilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't judge of these things by rule and measure," said my mother: "try
      my smelling-bottle, my dear." Very few people, especially women of
      delicate nerves and quick feelings, could, as my mother observed, bear to
      be laughed at; particularly by those they loved; and especially before
      other people who did not know them perfectly. My mother was persuaded, she
      said, that Lord Mowbray had not reflected on all this when he had laughed
      so inconsiderately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray allowed that he certainly had not reflected when he had laughed
      inconsiderately. "So come, come. Anne, sister Anne, be friends!" then
      playfully tapping his sister on the back, the pretty, but sullen back of
      the neck, he tried to raise the drooping head; but finding the chin resist
      the upward motion, and retire resentfully from his touch, he turned upon
      his heel, and addressing himself to me, "Well! Harrington," said he, "the
      news of the day, the news of the theatre, which I was bringing you full
      speed, when I stumbled upon this cursed half-pint of asses' milk, which
      Mrs.. Harrington was so angry with me for overturning&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's the news, my lord?" said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "News! not for you, ma'am, only for Harrington; news of the Jews."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Jews!" said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Jews!" said I, both in the same breath, but in very different tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Jews</i>, did I say?" replied Mowbray: "Jew, I should have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Montenero?" cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montenero!&mdash;Can you think of nothing but Mr. Montenero, whom you've
      never seen, and never will see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for that, my lord," said my mother; "one touch from you is
      worth a hundred from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But of what Jew then are you talking? and what's your news, my lord?"
      said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My news is only&mdash;for Heaven's sake, Harrington, do not look
      expecting a mountain, for 'tis only a mouse. The news is, that Macklin,
      the honest Jew of Venice, has got the pound, or whatever number of pounds
      he wanted to get from the manager's heart; the quarrel's made up, and if
      you keep your senses, you may have a chance to see, next week, this famous
      Jew of Venice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am heartily glad of it!" cried I, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that all?" said my mother, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Harrington," said Lady Anne, "is really so enthusiastic about some
      things, and so cold about others, there is no understanding him; he is
      very, very <i>odd</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all the pains my mother took to atone for my offence, and
      notwithstanding that I had humbled myself to the dust to obtain pardon, I
      was not forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady de Brantefield, Lady Anne, and some other company, dined with us; and
      Mowbray, who seemed to be really sorry that he had vexed his sister, and
      that he had in the heyday of his spirit unveiled to me her defects of
      temper, did every thing in his power to make up matters between us. At
      dinner he placed me beside Anne, little sister Anne; but no caressing
      tone, no diminutive of kindness in English, or soft Italian, could touch
      her heart, or move the gloomy purpose of her soul. Her sulky ladyship
      almost turned her back upon me, as she listened only to Colonel Topham,
      who was on the other side. Mowbray coaxed her to eat, but she refused
      every thing he offered&mdash;would not accept even his compliments&mdash;his
      compliments on her <i>pouf</i>&mdash;would not allow him to show her off,
      as he well knew how to do, to advantage; would not, when he exerted
      himself to prevent her silence from being remarked, smile at any one of
      the many entertaining things he said; she would not, in short, even
      passively permit his attempts to cover her ill-humour, and to make things
      pass off well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when the higher powers drew off to cards, and when Lady
      Anne had her phalanx of young ladies round her; and whilst I stood a
      defenceless young man at her mercy, she made me feel her vengeance. She
      talked <i>at</i> me continually, and at every opening gave me sly cuts,
      which she flattered herself I felt sorely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray turned off the blows as fast as they were aimed, or treated them
      all as playful traits of lover-like malice, tokens of a lady's favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! a good cut, Harrington!&mdash;Happy man!&mdash;Up to you there,
      Harrington! High favour, when a lady condescends to remember and
      retaliate. Paid you for old scores!&mdash;Sign you're in her books now!&mdash;'No
      more to say to you, Mr. Harrington'&mdash;a fair challenge to say a great
      deal more to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time her ladyship was aiming to vex, and hoping that I was
      heartily mortified, as from my silence and melancholy countenance she
      concluded that I was; in reality I stood deploring that so pretty a
      creature had so mean a mind. The only vexation I felt was at her having
      destroyed the possibility of my enjoying that delightful illusion which
      beauty creates.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother, who had been, as she said, quite nervous all this evening, at
      last brought Lady Anne to terms, and patched up a peace, by prevailing on
      Lady de Brantefield, who could not be prevailed on by any one else, to
      make a party to go to some new play which Lady Anne was <i>dying</i> to
      see. It was a sentimental comedy, and I did not much like it; however, I
      was all complaisance for my mother's sake, and she in return renewed her
      promise to go with me to patronize Shylock. By the extraordinary anxiety
      my mother showed, and by the pains she took that there should be peace
      betwixt Lady Anne and me, I perceived, what had never before struck me,
      that my mother wished me to be in love with her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I could sooner have been in love with Lady de Brantefield. Give her
      back a decent share of youth and beauty, I think I could sooner have liked
      the mother than the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the force and plastic power of my imagination, I could have turned and
      moulded Lady de Brantefield, with all her repulsive haughtiness, into a
      Clelia, or a Princess de Cleves, or something of the Richardson
      full-dressed heroine, with hoop and fan, and <i>stand off, man</i>!&mdash;and
      then there would be cruelty and difficulty, and
      incomprehensibility-something to be conquered&mdash;something to be wooed
      and won. But with Lady Anne Mowbray my imagination had nothing to work
      upon, no point to dwell on, nothing on which a lover's fancy could feed:
      there was no doubt, no hope, no fear, no reserve of manner, no dignity of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother, I believe, now saw that it would not do, at least for the
      present; but she had known many of Cupid's capricious turns. Lady Anne was
      extremely pretty, and universally allowed to be so; her ladyship was much
      taken notice of in public, and my mother knew that young men are vain of
      having their mistresses and wives admired by our sex. But my mother
      calculated ill as to my particular character. To the Opera and to
      Ranelagh, to the Pantheon, and to all the fashionable public places of the
      day, I had had the honour of attending Lady Anne; and I had had the glory
      of hearing "Beautiful!" "Who is she?"&mdash;and "Who is with her?" My
      vanity, I own, had been flattered, but no further. My imagination was
      always too powerful, my passions too sincere and too romantic, to be ruled
      by the opinions of others, or to become the dupe of personal vanity. My
      mother had fancied that a month or two in London would have brought my
      imagination down to be content with the realities of fashionable life. My
      mother was right as to the fact, but wrong in her conclusion. This did not
      incline me more towards Lady Anne, but it disinclined me towards marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      My exalted ideas of love were lowered&mdash;my morning visions of life
      fled&mdash;I was dispirited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray had rallied me on my pining for Cambridge, and on preferring
      Israel Lyons, the Jew, to him and all the best company in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hurried me about with him to all manner of gaieties, but still I
      was not happy; my mind&mdash;my heart wanted something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this my London life, I found it irksome that I could never, as at dear
      Cambridge, pause upon my own reflections. If I stopped awhile, "to plume
      contemplation's wings, so ruffled and impaired," some of the low
      realities, some of the impertinent necessities of fashionable life, would
      tread on my heels. The order of the day or night was for ever pressed upon
      me&mdash;and the order of the day was now to go to this new sentimental
      comedy&mdash;my mother's favourite actor, the silver-toned Barry, was to
      play the lover of the piece; so she was sure of as many fashionable young
      ladies as her box could possibly hold. At this period, in England, every
      fashionable belle declared herself the partisan of some actor or actress;
      and every fashionable beau aspired to the character of a dramatic critic.
      Mowbray, of course, was distinguished in that line, and his pretty little
      sister, Lady Anne, was, at least in face, formed to grace the front box.
      The hours of the great world were earlier then than they are now, and
      nothing interfered, indeed nothing would have been suffered to interfere,
      with the hour for the play. As a veteran wit described it, "There were at
      this time four estates in the English Constitution, kings, lords, commons,
      and the theatre." Statesmen, courtiers, poets, philosophers, crowded pell
      mell with the white-gloved beaux to the stage box and the pit. It was
      thought well-bred, it was <i>the thing</i> to be in the boxes before the
      third act, even before the second, nay, incredible as it may in these
      times appear, before the first act began. Our fashionable party was seated
      some minutes before the curtain drew up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The beaux and belles in the boxes of the crowded theatre had bowed and
      curtsied, for in those days beaux did bow and belles did curtsy; the
      impatient sticks in the pit, and shrill catcalls in the gallery, had begun
      to contend with the music in the orchestra; and thrice had we surveyed the
      house to recognize every body whom any body knew, when the door of the box
      next to ours, the only box that had remained empty, was thrown open, and
      in poured an over-dressed party, whom <i>nobody knew</i>. Lady de
      Brantefield, after one reconnoitring glance, pronounced them to be city
      Goths and Vandals; and without resting her glass upon them for half a
      moment, turned it to some more profitable field of speculation. There was
      no gentleman of this party, but a portly matron, towering above the rest,
      seemed the principal mover and orderer of the group. The awkward bustle
      they made, facing and backing, placing and changing of places, and the
      difficulty they found in seating themselves, were in striking contrast
      with the high-bred ease of the ladies of our party. Lady Anne Mowbray
      looked down upon their operations with a pretty air of quiet surprise,
      tinctured with horror; while my mother's shrinking delicacy endeavoured to
      suggest some idea of propriety to the city matron, who having taken her
      station next to us in the second row, had at last seated herself so that a
      considerable portion of the back part of her head-dress was in my mother's
      face: moreover, the citizen's huge arm, with its enormous gauze cuff,
      leaning on the partition which divided, or ought to have divided, her from
      us, considerably passed the line of demarcation. Lady de Brantefield, with
      all the pride of all the De Brantefields since the Norman Conquest
      concentrated in her countenance, threw an excommunicating, withering look
      upon the arm&mdash;but the elbow felt it not&mdash;it never stirred. The
      lady seemed not to be made of penetrable stuff. In happy ignorance she sat
      fanning herself for a few seconds; then suddenly starting and stretching
      forward to the front row, where five of her young ladies were wedged, she
      aimed with her fan at each of their backs in quick succession, and in a
      more than audible whisper asked, "Cecy! Issy! Henny! Queeney! Miss Coates,
      where's Berry?"&mdash;All eyes turned to look for Berry&mdash;"Oh! mercy,
      behind in the back row! Miss Berry, that must not be&mdash;come forward,
      here's my place or Queeney's," cried Mrs. Coates, stretching backwards
      with her utmost might to seize some one in the farthest corner of the back
      row, who had hitherto been invisible. We expected to see in Miss Berry
      another vulgarian produced, but to our surprise, we beheld one who seemed
      of a different order of beings from those by whom she was surrounded. Lord
      Mowbray and I looked at each other, struck by the same sentiment, pained
      for this elegant timid young creature, as we saw her, all blushing and
      reluctant, forced by the irresistible fat orderer of all things to "step
      up on the seat," to step forward from bench to bench, and then wait in
      painful pre-eminence while Issy, and Cecy, and Queeney, and Miss Coates,
      settled how they could make room, or which should vacate her seat in her
      favour. In spite of the awkwardness of her situation she stood with such
      quiet, resigned, yet dignified grace, that ridicule could not touch her.
      The moment she was seated with her back to us, and out of hearing, Lady de
      Brantefield turned to her son and asked "Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An East Indian, I should guess, by her dark complexion," whispered Lady
      Anne to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some feather or lappet intercepted my view of her face, but from the
      glimpse I caught of it as she passed, it struck me as uncommonly
      interesting, though with a peculiar expression and foreign air&mdash;whether
      she was handsome or not, though called upon to decide, I could not
      determine. But now our attention was fixed on the stage. It was announced
      to the audience that, owing to the sudden illness of the actor who was to
      have performed the principal part in the comedy advertised for this night,
      there was a necessity for changing the play, and they should give in its
      stead the Merchant of Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Merchant of Venice and Macklin the Jew!&mdash;Murmurs of discontent
      from the ladies in my box, who regretted their sentimental comedy and
      their silver-toned Barry, were all lost upon me; I rejoiced that I should
      see Macklin in Shylock. Before the performance began, my attention was
      again caught by the proceedings of the persons in the next box. There
      seemed to be some sudden cause of distress, as I gathered from
      exclamations of "How unlucky!&mdash;How distressing!&mdash;What shall we
      do?&mdash;What can we do?&mdash;Better go away&mdash;carriage gone!&mdash;must
      sit it out&mdash;May be she won't mind&mdash;Oh! she will&mdash;Shylock!&mdash;Jessica!&mdash;How
      unfortunate!&mdash;poor Miss Berry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jessica!" whispered Mowbray to me, with an arch look: "let me pass,"
      added he, just touching my shoulder. He made his way to a young lady at
      the other end of the box; and I, occupying immediately the ceded place,
      stationed myself so that I had a better view of my object, and could
      observe her without being seen by any one. She was perfectly still, and
      took no notice of the whispering of the people about her, though, from an
      indescribable expression in the air of the back of her head and neck, I
      was convinced that she heard all that passed among the young and old
      ladies in her box. The play went on&mdash;Shylock appeared&mdash;I forgot
      every thing but him.&mdash;Such a countenance!&mdash;Such an expression of
      latent malice and revenge, of every thing detestable in human nature!
      Whether speaking or silent, the Jew fixed and kept possession of my
      attention. It was an incomparable piece of acting: much as my expectations
      had been raised, it far surpassed any thing I had conceived&mdash;I forgot
      it was Macklin, I thought only of Shylock. In my enthusiasm I stood up, I
      pressed forward, I leaned far over towards the stage, that I might not
      lose a word, a look, a gesture. When the act finished, as the curtain
      fell, and the thunders of applause died away, I heard a soft low sigh near
      me; I looked, and saw the Jewess! She had turned away from the young
      ladies her companions, and had endeavoured to screen herself behind the
      pillar against which I had been leaning. I had, for the first time, a full
      view of her face and of her countenance, of great sensibility, painfully,
      proudly repressed. She looked up while my eyes were fixed upon her&mdash;a
      sudden and deep colour spread over her face and mounted to her temples. In
      my confusion I did the very thing I should not have done, and said the
      thing of all others I should not have said. I expressed a fear that I had
      been standing in such a manner as to prevent her from seeing Shylock; she
      bowed mildly, and was, I believe, going to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have indeed, sir," interrupted Mrs. Coates, "stood so that nobody
      could see nothing but yourself. So, since you mention it, and speak
      without an introduction, excuse me if I suggest, against the next act,
      that this young lady has never been at a play before in her life&mdash;in
      Lon'on, at least. And though it i'n't the play I should have chose for
      her, yet since she is here, 'tis better she should see something than
      nothing, if gentlemen will give her leave." I bowed in sign of submission
      and repentance; and was retiring, so as to leave my place vacant, and a
      full opening to the stage. But in a sweet, gentlewomanlike voice, seeming,
      perhaps, more delightful from contrast, the young lady said that she had
      seen and could see quite as much as she wished of the play; and she begged
      that I would not quit my place. "I should oblige her," she added, in a
      lower tone, "if I would continue to stand as I had done." I obeyed, and
      placed myself so as to screen her from observation during the whole of the
      next act. But now, my pleasure in the play was over. I could no longer
      enjoy Macklin's incomparable acting; I was so apprehensive of the pain
      which it must give to the young Jewess. At every stroke, characteristic of
      the skilful actor, or of the master poet, I felt a strange mixture of
      admiration and regret. I almost wished that Shakspeare had not written, or
      Macklin had not acted the part so powerfully: my imagination formed such a
      strong conception of the pain the Jewess was feeling, and my inverted
      sympathy, if I may so call it, so overpowered my direct and natural
      feelings, that at every fresh development of the Jew's villany I shrunk as
      though I had myself been a Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each exclamation against this dog of a Jew, and still more every general
      reflection on Jewish usury, avarice, and cruelty, I felt poignantly. No
      power of imagination could make me pity Shylock, but I felt the force of
      some of his appeals to justice; and some passages struck me in quite a new
      light on the Jewish side of the question.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Many a time, and oft,
    In the Rialto, you have rated me,
    About my moneys and my usances;
    Still have I borne it with a patient shrug;
    For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
    You call me misbeliever! cut-throat dog!
    And spit upon my Jewish gabardine;
    And all, for use of that which is my own.
    Well, then, it now appears you need my help.
    Go to, then&mdash;you come to me, and you say,
    Shylock, we would have moneys; you say so.

</pre>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I bend low, and in a bondsman key, With bated breath, and whisp'ring
      humbleness, Say this&mdash;Fair sir, you spit on me last Wednesday; You
      spurned me such a day; another time You called me dog; and for these
      courtesies I'll lend you thus much moneys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as Shylock was concerned, I was well content he should be used in
      such a sort; but if it had been any other human creature, any other Jew
      even&mdash;if it had been poor Jacob, for instance, whose image crossed my
      recollection&mdash;I believe I should have taken part with him. Again, I
      was well satisfied that Antonio should have hindered Shylock of half a
      million, should have laughed at his losses, thwarted his bargains, cooled
      his friends, heated his enemies; Shylock deserved all this: but when he
      came to, "What's his reason?&mdash;I am a <i>Jew</i>. Hath not a Jew eyes?
      Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
      fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same
      diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter
      and summer as a Christian is?&mdash;If you prick us, do we not bleed?&mdash;If
      you tickle us, do we not laugh?&mdash;If you poison us, do not we die?&mdash;and
      if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we
      will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his
      humility?&mdash;Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his
      sufferance be, by Christian example?&mdash;Why, revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt at once horror of the individual Shylock, and submission to the
      strength of his appeal. During the third act, during the Jessica scenes, I
      longed so much to have a look at the Jewess, that I took an opportunity of
      changing my position. The ladies in our box were now so happily occupied
      with some young officers of the guards, that there was no farther danger
      of their staring at the Jewess. I was so placed that I could see her,
      without being seen; and during the succeeding acts, my attention was
      chiefly directed to the study of all the changes in her expressive
      countenance. I now saw and heard the play solely with reference to her
      feelings; I anticipated every stroke which could touch her, and became
      every moment more and more interested and delighted with her, from the
      perception that my anticipations were just, and that I perfectly knew how
      to read her soul, and interpret her countenance. I saw that the struggle
      to repress her emotion was often the utmost she could endure; and at last
      I saw, or fancied I saw, that she grew so pale, that, as she closed her
      eyes at the same instant, I was certain she was going to faint; and quite
      forgetting that I was an utter stranger to her, I started forward&mdash;and
      then unprovided with an apology, could only turn to Mrs. Coates, and fear
      that the heat of the house was too much for this young lady. Mrs. Coates,
      alarmed immediately, wished they could get her out into the air, and
      regretted that her gentlemen were not with their party to-night&mdash;there
      could be no getting servants or carriage&mdash;what could be done? I
      eagerly offered my services, which were accepted, and we conducted the
      young lady out. She did not faint; she struggled against it; and it was
      evident that there was no affectation in the case; but, on the contrary,
      an anxious desire not to give trouble, and a great dread of exposing
      herself to public observation. The carriage, as Mrs. Coates repeated
      twenty times, was ordered not to come till after the farce, and she kept
      on hoping and hoping that Miss Berry would be stout enough to go back to
      see "The Maid of the Oaks." Miss Berry did her utmost to support herself;
      and said she believed she was now quite well, and could return; but I saw
      she wished to get away, and I ran to see if a chair could be had. Lord
      Mowbray, who had assisted in conducting the ladies out, now followed me;
      he saw, and called to one of his footmen, and despatched him for a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now," said Mowbray, "we may leave the rest to Mrs. Coates, who can
      elbow her own way through it. Come back with me&mdash;Mrs. Abingdon plays
      Lady Bab Lardoon, her favourite character&mdash;she is incomparable, and I
      would not miss it for the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged Mowbray to go back, for I could not leave these ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, parting from me, and pursuing his own way, "I see how it
      is&mdash;I see how it will be. These things are ruled in heaven above, or
      hell beneath. 'Tis in vain struggling with one's destiny&mdash;so you to
      your Jewess, and I to my little Jessica. We shall have her again, I hope,
      in the farce, the prettiest creature I ever saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray hastened back to his box, and how long it might be between my
      return to the Jewess, and the arrival of the chair, I do not know: it
      seemed to me not above two minutes, but Mowbray insisted upon it, that it
      was a full quarter of an hour. He came to me again, just as I had received
      one look of silent gratitude; and while I was putting the young lady into
      the chair, and bustling Mrs. Coates was giving her orders and address to
      the servant, Mowbray whispered me that my mother was in an agony, and had
      sent him out to see what was become of me. Mrs. Coates, all thanks, and
      apologies, and hurry, now literally elbowed her way back to her box,
      expressing her reiterated fears that we should lose the best part of "The
      Maid of the Oaks," which was the only farce she made it a rule ever to
      stay for. In spite of her hurry and her incessant talking, I named the
      thing I was intent upon. I said, that with her permission I should do
      myself the honour of calling upon her the next morning to inquire after
      Miss Berry's health.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure, sir," she replied, "Mr. Alderman Coates, and myself, will be
      particularly glad of the honour of seeing you tomorrow, or any time; and
      moreover, sir, the young lady," added she, with a shrewd, and to me
      offensive smile, "the young lady no doubt's well worth inquiring after&mdash;a
      great heiress, as the saying is, as rich as a Jew she'll be, Miss
      Montenero."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Montenero!" repeated Lord Mowbray and I, in the same instant. "I
      thought," said I, "this young lady's name was Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Berry, yes&mdash;Berry, we call her, we who are intimate, I call her for
      short&mdash;that is short for Berenice, which is her out o' the way
      Christian, that is, Jewish name. Mr. Montenero, the father, is a Spanish
      or American Jew, I'm not clear which, but he's a charming man for a Jew,
      and the daughter most uncommon fond of him, to a degree! Can't, now, bear
      any reflections the most distant, now, sir, upon the Jews, which was what
      distressed me when I found the play was to be this Jew of Venice, and I
      would have come away, only that I couldn't possibly." Here Mrs. Coates,
      without any mercy upon my curiosity about Mr. Montenero and his daughter,
      digressed into a subject utterly uninteresting to me, and would explain to
      us the reasons why Mr. Alderman Coates and Mr. Peter Coates her son were
      not this night of her party. This lasted till we reached her box, and then
      she had so much to say to all the Miss Issys, Cecys, and Hennys, that it
      was with the utmost difficulty I could, even by carefully watching my
      moment, obtain a card with her own, and another with Miss Montenero's
      address. This time there was no danger of my losing it. I rejoiced to see
      that Miss Montenero did not live with Mrs. Coates.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all further satisfaction of my curiosity, I was obliged to wait till
      the next morning.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the whole of the night, sleeping or waking, the images of the fair
      Jewess, of Shylock, and of Mrs. Coates, were continually recurring, and
      turning into one another in a most provoking manner. At breakfast my
      mother did not appear; my father said that she had not slept well, and
      that she would breakfast in her own apartment; this was not unusual; but I
      was particularly sorry that it happened this morning, because, being left
      <i>tte--tte</i> with my father, and he full of a debate on the
      malt-tax, which he undertook to read to me from the rival papers, and to
      make me understand its merits, I was compelled to sit three-quarters of an
      hour longer after breakfast than I had intended; so that the plan I had
      formed of waiting upon Mr. Montenero very early, before he could have gone
      out for the day, was disconcerted. When at last my father had fairly
      finished, when he had taken his hat and his cane, and departing left me,
      as I thought, happily at liberty to go in search of my Jewess, another
      detainer came. At the foot of the stairs my mother's woman appeared,
      waiting to let me know that her lady begged I would not go out till she
      had seen me&mdash;adding, that she would be with me in less than a quarter
      of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flung down my hat, I believe, with rather too marked an expression of
      impatience; but five minutes afterwards came a knock at the door. Mr.
      Montenero was announced, and I blessed my mother, my father, and the
      malt-tax, for having detained me at home. The first appearance of Mr.
      Montenero more than answered my expectations. He had that indescribable
      air, which, independently of the fashion of the day, or the mode of any
      particular country, distinguishes a gentleman&mdash;dignified, courteous,
      and free from affectation. From his features, he might have been thought a
      Spaniard&mdash;from his complexion, an East Indian; but he had a peculiar
      cast of countenance, which seemed not to belong to either nation. He had
      uncommonly black penetrating eyes, with a serious, rather melancholy, but
      very benevolent expression. He was past the meridian of life. The lines in
      his face were strongly marked; but they were not the common-place wrinkles
      of ignoble age, nor the contractions of any of the vulgar passions: they
      seemed to be the traces of thought and feeling. He entered into
      conversation directly and easily. I need not say that this conversation
      was immediately interesting, for he spoke of Berenice. His thanks to me
      were, I thought, peculiarly gentlemanlike, neither too much nor too
      little. Of course, I left him at liberty to attribute her indisposition to
      the heat of the playhouse, and I stood prepared to avoid mentioning
      Shylock to Jewish ears; but I was both surprised and pleased by the
      openness and courage with which he spoke on the very subject from which I
      had fancied he would have shrunk. Instead of looking for any excuse for
      Miss Montenero's indisposition, he at once named the real cause; she had
      been, he said, deeply affected by the representation of Shylock; that
      detestable Jew, whom the genius of the greatest poet that ever wrote, and
      the talents of one of the greatest actors who had ever appeared, had
      conspired to render an object of public execration. "But recently arrived
      in London," continued Mr. Montenero, "I have not had personal opportunity
      of judging of this actor's talent; but no Englishman can have felt more
      strongly than I have, the power of your Shakspeare's genius to touch and
      rend the human heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero spoke English with a foreign accent, and something of a
      foreign idiom; but his ideas and feelings forced their way regardless of
      grammatical precision, and I thought his foreign accent agreeable. To an
      Englishman, what accent that conveys the praise of Shakspeare can fail to
      be agreeable? The most certain method by which a foreigner an introduce
      himself at once to the good-will and good opinion of an Englishman, is by
      thus doing homage to this national object of idolatry. I perceived that
      Mr. Montenero's was not a mere compliment&mdash;he spoke with real
      feeling. "In this instance," resumed he, "we poor Jews have felt your
      Shakspeare's power to our cost&mdash;too severely, and, considering all
      the circumstances, rather unjustly, you are aware."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Considering all the circumstances</i>," I did not precisely
      understand; but I endeavoured, as well as I could, to make some general
      apology for Shakspeare's severity, by adverting to the time when he wrote,
      and the prejudices which then prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said he; "and as a dramatic poet, it was his business, I
      acknowledge, to take advantage of the popular prejudice as a <i>power</i>&mdash;as
      a means of dramatic pathos and effect; yet you will acknowledge that we
      Jews must feel it peculiarly hard, that the truth of the story on which
      the poet founded his plot should have been completely sacrificed to
      fiction, so that the characters were not only misrepresented, but
      reversed."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know to what Mr. Montenero meant to allude: however, I
      endeavoured to pass it off with a slight bow of general acquiescence, and
      the hundred-times-quoted remark, that poets always succeed better in
      fiction than in truth. Mr. Montenero had quick penetration&mdash;he saw my
      evasion, and would not let me off so easily. He explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the <i>true</i> story, [Footnote: See Stevens' Life of Sixtus V., and
      Malone's Shakspeare.] from which Shakspeare took the plot of the Merchant
      of Venice, it was a Christian who acted the part of the Jew, and the Jew
      that of the Christian; it was a Christian who insisted upon having the
      pound of flesh from next the Jew's heart. But," as Mr. Montenero repeated,
      "Shakspeare was right, as a dramatic poet, in reversing the characters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing me struck, and a little confounded, by this statement, and even by
      his candour, Mr. Montenero said, that perhaps his was only the Jewish
      version of the story, and he quickly went on to another subject, one far
      more agreeable to me&mdash;to Berenice. He hoped that I did not suspect
      her of affectation from any thing that had passed; he was aware, little as
      he knew of fine ladies, that they sometimes were pleased to make
      themselves noticed, perhaps rather troublesome, by the display of their
      sensibility; but he assured me that his Berenice was not of this sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this I was perfectly convinced. The moment he pronounced the name of
      Berenice, he paused, and looked as if he were afraid he should say too
      much of her; and I suppose I looked as I felt&mdash;afraid that he would
      not say enough. He gently bowed his head and went on. "There are reasons
      why she was peculiarly touched and moved by that exhibition. Till she came
      to Europe&mdash;to England&mdash;she was not aware, at least not
      practically aware, of the strong prepossessions which still prevail
      against us Jews." He then told me that his daughter had passed her
      childhood chiefly in America, "in a happy part of that country, where
      religious distinctions are scarcely known&mdash;where characters and
      talents are all sufficient to attain advancement&mdash;where the Jews form
      a respectable part of the community&mdash;where, in most instances, they
      are liberally educated, many following the honourable professions of law
      and physic with credit and ability, and associating with the best society
      that country affords. Living in a retired village, her father's the only
      family of Israelites who resided in or near it, all her juvenile
      friendships and attachments had been formed with those of different
      persuasions; yet each had looked upon the variations of the other as
      things of course, or rather as things which do not affect the moral
      character&mdash;differences which take place in every society."&mdash;"My
      daughter was, therefore, ill prepared," said Mr. Montenero, "for European
      prepossessions; and with her feeling heart and strong affection for those
      she loves, no wonder that she has often suffered, especially on my
      account, since we came to England; and she has become, to a fault, tender
      and susceptible on this point."
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not admit that there was any fault on her part; but I regretted
      that England should be numbered among the countries subject to such
      prejudices. I hoped, I added, that such illiberality was now confined to
      the vulgar, that is, the ill-educated and the ill-informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The well-educated and well-informed, he answered, were, of course, always
      the most liberal, and were usually the same in all countries. He begged
      pardon if he had expressed himself too generally with respect to England.
      It was the common fault of strangers and foreigners to generalize too
      quickly, and to judge precipitately of the whole of a community from a
      part. The fact was, that he had, by the business which brought him to
      London, been unfortunately thrown among some vulgar rich of contracted
      minds, who, though they were, as he was willing to believe, essentially
      good and good-natured persons, had made his Berenice suffer, sometimes
      more than they could imagine, by their want of delicacy, and want of
      toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Montenero spoke these words, the image of vulgar, ordering Mrs.
      Coates&mdash;that image which had persecuted me half the night, by ever
      obtruding between me and the fair Jewess&mdash;rose again full in my view.
      I settled immediately, that it was she and her tribe of Issys, and Cecys,
      and Hennys, and Queeneys, were "the vulgar rich" to whom Mr. Montenero
      alluded. I warmly expressed my indignation against those who could have
      been so brutal as to make Miss Montenero suffer by their vile prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Brutal</i>," Mr. Montenero repeated, smiling at my warmth, "is too
      strong an expression: there was no brutality in the case. I must have
      expressed myself ill to give rise to such an idea. There was only a little
      want of consideration for the feelings of others&mdash;a little want of
      liberality."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so I could not bear the thought that Miss Montenero should have been,
      on her first arrival in England, thrown among persons who might give her
      quite a false idea of the English, and a dislike to the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no danger of that sort," he replied. "Had she been disposed to
      judge so rashly and uncharitably, the humane and polite attentions she met
      with last night from a gentleman who was an utter stranger to her, and who
      could only know that she was a foreigner in want of assistance, must have
      been to her at once conviction and reproof." (I bowed, delighted with Mr.
      Montenero and with myself.) "But I hope and believe," continued he, "that
      my Berenice is not disposed to form uncharitable judgments either of
      individuals or nations; especially not of the English, of whom she has,
      from their history and literature, with which we are not wholly
      unacquainted, conceived the highest ideas." I bowed again, though not
      quite so much delighted with this general compliment to my nation as by
      that peculiar to myself. I expressed my hopes that the English would
      justify this favourable prepossession, and that on farther acquaintance
      with different societies in London, Mr. and Miss Montenero would find,
      that among the higher classes in this country there is no want of
      liberality of opinion, and certainly no want of delicacy of sentiment and
      manner&mdash;no want of attention to the feelings of those who are of a
      different persuasion from ourselves. Just at this moment my mother entered
      the room. Advancing towards Mr. Montenero, she said, with a gracious
      smile, "You need not introduce us to each other, my dear Harrington, for I
      am sure that I have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Clive, from India."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Montenero, from America, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Montenero! I am happy to have the honour&mdash;the pleasure&mdash;I
      am very happy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother's politeness struggled against truth; but whilst I feared that
      Mr. Montenero's penetration would discern that there was no pleasure in
      the honour, a polite inquiry followed concerning Miss Montenero's
      indisposition. Then, after an ineffectual effort to resume the ease and
      cordiality of her manner, my mother leaned back languidly on the sofa, and
      endeavoured to account for the cloud which settled on her brow by
      adverting to the sleepless night she had passed, and to the fears of an
      impending headache; assuring Mr. Montenero at the same time that society
      and conversation were always of service to her. I was particularly anxious
      to detain, and to draw him out before my mother, because I felt persuaded
      that his politeness of manner, and his style of conversation, would
      counteract any <i>presentiment</i> or prejudice she had conceived against
      him and his race. He seemed to lend himself to my views, and with
      benevolent politeness exerted himself to entertain my mother. A Don
      Quixote was on the table, in which there were some good prints, and from
      these he took occasion to give us many amusing and interesting accounts of
      Spain, where he had passed the early part of his life. From Don Quixote to
      Gil Blas&mdash;to the Duc de Lerma&mdash;to the tower of Segovia&mdash;to
      the Inquisition&mdash;to the Spanish palaces and Moorish antiquities, he
      let me lead him backwards and forwards as I pleased. My mother was very
      fond of some of the old Spanish ballads and Moorish romances: I led to the
      <i>Rio Verde</i>, and the fair Zaida, and the Moor Alcanzor, with whom
      both in their Moorish and English dress Mr. Montenero was well acquainted,
      and of whom he was enthusiastically fond.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was fond of painting: I asked some questions concerning the
      Spanish painters, particularly about Murillo; of one of his pictures we
      had a copy, and my mother had often wished to see the original. Mr.
      Montenero said he was happy in having it in his power to gratify her wish;
      he possessed the original of this picture. But few of Murillo's paintings
      had at this time found their way out of Spain; national and regal pride
      had preserved them with jealous care; but Mr. Montenero had inherited some
      of Murillo's master-pieces. These, and a small but valuable collection of
      pictures which he had been many years in forming, were now in England:
      they were not yet arranged as he could wish, but an apartment was
      preparing for them; and in the mean time, he should be happy to have the
      honour of showing them to us and to any of our friends. He particularly
      addressed himself to my mother; she replied in those general terms of
      acquiescence and gratitude, which are used when there is no real intention
      to accept an invitation, but yet a wish to avoid such an absolute refusal
      as should appear ill-bred. I, on the contrary, sincerely eager to accept
      the offered favour, fixed instantly the time, and the soonest possible. I
      named the next day at one o'clock. Mr. Montenero then took his leave, and
      as the door closed after him, I stood before my mother, as if waiting for
      judgment; she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think him agreeable, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very agreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you would think so, my dear mother; an uncommonly agreeable man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But so much the worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, ma'am? Because he is a Jew, is he forbidden to be agreeable?"
      said I, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray be serious, Harrington&mdash;I say the more agreeable this man is,
      the better his manner, the more extensive his information, the higher the
      abilities he possesses, the greater are his means of doing mischief." "A
      conclusive argument," said. I, "against the possession of good manners,
      information, abilities, and every agreeable and useful quality! and an
      argument equally applicable to Jews and Christians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Argument!" repeated my mother: "I know, my dear, I am not capable of
      arguing with you&mdash;indeed I am not fond of arguments, they are so
      unfeminine: I seldom presume to give even my opinion, except on subjects
      of sentiment and feeling; there ladies may venture, I suppose, to have a
      voice as well as gentlemen, perhaps better, sometimes. In the present
      case, it may be very ridiculous; but I own that, notwithstanding this Mr.
      Montenero is what you'd call an uncommonly agreeable man, there is a
      something about him&mdash;in short, I feel something like an antipathy to
      him&mdash;and in the whole course of my life I have never been misled by
      these <i>antipathies</i>. I don't say they are reasonable, I only say that
      I can't help feeling them; and if they never mislead us, you know they
      have all the force of instincts, and in some cases instincts are superior
      even to that reason of which man is so proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not advert to the <i>if</i>, on which this whole reasoning rested,
      but I begged my mother would put herself out of the question for one
      moment, and consider to what injustice and intolerance such antipathies
      would lead in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps in general it might be so," she said; "but in this particular
      instance she was persuaded she was right and <i>correct</i>; and after
      all, is there a human being living who is not influenced at first sight by
      countenance! Does not Lavater say that even a cockchafer and a dish of tea
      have a physiognomy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not go quite so far as to admit the cockchafer's physiognomy in
      our judgment of characters. "But then, ma'am," concluded I, "before we can
      judge, before we can decide, we should see what is called the play of the
      countenance&mdash;we should see the working of the muscles. Now, for
      instance, when we have seen Mr. Montenero two or three times, when we have
      studied the muscles of his countenance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! I study the muscles of the man's countenance!" interrupted my mother,
      indignantly; "I never desire to see him or his muscles again! Jew, Turk,
      or <i>Mussulman</i>, let me hear no more about him. Seriously, my dear
      Harrington, this is the subject on which I wished to speak to you this
      morning, to warn you from forming this dangerous acquaintance. I dreamed
      last night&mdash;but I know you won't listen to dreams; I have a <i>presentiment</i>&mdash;but
      you have no faith in <i>presentiments</i>: what shall I say to you?&mdash;Oh!
      my dear Harrington, I appeal to your own heart&mdash;your own feelings,
      your own conscience, must tell you all I at this moment foresee and dread.
      Oh! with your ardent, too ardent imagination&mdash;your susceptibility!
      Surely, surely, there is an absolute fatality in these things! At the very
      moment I was preparing to warn you, Mr. Montenero appears, and strengthens
      the dangerous impression. And after all the pains I took to prevent your
      ever meeting, is it not extraordinary that you should meet his daughter at
      the playhouse? Promise me, I conjure you," cried she, turning and seizing
      both my hands, "promise me, my dear son, that you will see no more of this
      Jew and Jewess."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a promise I could not, would not make:&mdash;some morning visitors
      came in and relieved me. My mother's imagination was as vivacious, but not
      as tenacious as my own. There was in her a feminine mobility, which, to my
      masculine strength of passion, and consequent tenacity of purpose,
      appeared often inconceivable, and sometimes provoking. In a few minutes
      her fancy turned to old china and new lace, and all the fears which had so
      possessed and agitated her mind subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the crowd of morning visitors, Lady Anne Mowbray ran in and ran out;
      fortunately she could not stay one minute, and still more fortunately my
      mother did not hear a word she said, or even see her ladyship's exit and
      entrance, so many ladies had encompassed my mother's sofa, displaying
      charming bargains of French lace. The subject abstracted their attention,
      and engrossed all their faculties. Lady Anne had just called to tell me a
      secret, that her mother had been saying all the morning to every body, how
      odd it was of Mr. Harrington to take notice whether a Jewess fainted or
      not. Lady Anne said, for her part, she had taken my part; she did not
      think it <i>so</i> odd of me, but she thought it odd and ridiculous of the
      Jewess to faint about Shylock. But the reason she called was, because she
      was dying with curiosity to know if I had heard any more about the Jewess.
      Was she an heiress or not? I must find out and tell: she had heard&mdash;but
      she could not stay now&mdash;going to ride in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had often observed that my mother's <i>presentiments</i> varied from day
      to day, according to the state of her nerves, or of some slight external
      circumstances. I was extremely anxious to prevail upon her to accompany me
      to see the Spanish pictures, and I therefore put off my visit for a day,
      when I found my mother had engaged herself to attend a party of fair
      encouragers of smugglers to a cheap French lace shop. I wrote an apology
      to Mr. Montenero, and Heaven knows how much it cost me. But my heroic
      patience was of no avail; I could not persuade my mother to accompany me.
      To all her former feelings, the pride of opinion and the jealousy of
      maternal affection were now added; she was piqued to prove herself in the
      right, and vexed to see that, right or wrong, I would not yield to her
      entreaties. I thought I acted solely from the dictates of pure reason and
      enlightened philanthropy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mowbray was curious, he said, to know how the Jewess would look by
      daylight, and he begged that he might accompany me to see the pictures. As
      I had told him that I had permission to take with me any of my friends, I
      could not refuse his request, though I must own that I would rather have
      gone without him. I was a little afraid of his raillery, and of the
      quickness of his observation. During our walk, however, he with address&mdash;with
      that most irresistible kind of address, which assumes an air of perfect
      frankness and cordiality, contrived to dissipate my feelings of
      embarrassment; and by the time we got to Mr. Montenero's door, I rejoiced
      that I had with me a friend and supporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A handsome house&mdash;a splendid house, this," said Mowbray, looking up
      at the front, as we waited for admission. "If the inside agree with the
      out, faith, Harrington, your Jewish heiress will soon be heard of on
      'Change, and at court too, you'll see. Make haste and secure your interest
      in her, I advise you."
    </p>
    <p>
      To our great disappointment the servant told us that neither Mr. nor Miss
      Montenero was at home. But orders had been left with a young man of his to
      attend me and my company. At this moment I heard a well-known voice on the
      stairs, and Jacob, poor Jacob, appeared: joy flashed in his face at the
      sight of me; he flew down stairs, and across the hall, exclaiming, "It is&mdash;it
      is my own good Mr. Harrington!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he started back at the sight of Mowbray, and his whole countenance and
      manner changed. In an embarrassed voice, he began to explain why Mr.
      Montenero was not at home; that he had waited yesterday in hopes of seeing
      me at the appointed time, till my note of apology had arrived. I had not
      positively named any day for my visit, and Mr. Montenero had particular
      business that obliged him to go out this morning, but that he would be
      back in an hour: "Meantime, sir, as Mr. Montenero has desired," said
      Jacob, "I shall have the honour of showing the pictures to you and your
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till he came to the words <i>your friend</i>, that Jacob
      recollected to bow to Lord Mowbray, and even then it was a stiff-necked
      bow. Mowbray, contrary to his usual assurance, looked a little
      embarrassed, yet spoke to Jacob as to an old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob led us through several handsome, I might say splendid, apartments,
      to the picture-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Good!" whispered Mowbray, as we went along, till the moment we
      entered the picture-room; then making a sudden stop, and start of
      recollection, and pulling out his watch, he declared that he had till that
      minute forgotten an indispensable engagement&mdash;that he must come some
      other day to see these charming pictures. He begged that I would settle
      that for him&mdash;he was excessively sorry, but go he must&mdash;and off
      he went immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant he was out of sight, Jacob seemed relieved from the
      disagreeable constraint under which he laboured, and his delight was
      manifest when he had me to himself. I conceived that Jacob still felt
      resentment against Mowbray, for the old quarrel at school. I was surprised
      at this, and in my own mind I blamed Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always found it the best way to speak openly, and to go to the
      bottom of mysteries and quarrels at once: so turning to Jacob, I asked
      him, whether, in right of our former acquaintance, I might speak to him
      with the freedom of one who heartily wished him well? The tears came into
      his eyes, and he could only say, "Speak, pray&mdash;and thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Jacob," said I, "I thought you could not for such a number of years
      bear malice for a schoolboy's offence; and yet your manner just now to
      Lord Mowbray&mdash;am I mistaken?&mdash;set me right, if I am&mdash;did I
      misinterpret your manner, Jacob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said he, looking up in my face, with his genuine expression of
      simplicity and openness; "no, sir, you do not mistake, nor misinterpret
      Jacob's manner; you know him too well, and his manner tells too plainly;
      you do not misinterpret the feeling, but you mistake the cause; and since
      you are so kind as to desire me to set you right, I will do so; but it is
      too long a story to tell while you are standing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all&mdash;I am interested&mdash;go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not," said Jacob, "be worthy of this interest&mdash;this regard,
      which it is joy to my very heart to see that you still feel for me&mdash;I
      should not be worthy in the least of it, if I could bear malice so many
      years for a schoolboy's offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Harrington, the schoolboy young lord is forgotten. But long since
      that time, since this young lord has been grown into a man, and an officer&mdash;at
      Gibraltar&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The recollection of whatever it was that happened at Gibraltar seemed to
      come at this instant so full upon Jacob's feelings, that he could not go
      on. He took up his story farther back. He reminded me of the time when we
      had parted at Cambridge; he was then preparing to go to Gibraltar, to
      assist in keeping a store there, for the brother and partner of his friend
      and benefactor, the London jeweller, Mr. Manessa, who had ventured a very
      considerable part of his fortune upon this speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that time many Jews had enriched themselves at Gibraltar, by keeping
      stores for the troops; and during the siege it was expected that it would
      be a profitable business. Mr. Manessa's store under Jacob's care went on
      prosperously till the day when Lord Mowbray arrived at Gibraltar with a
      regiment, of which, young as he was, he had been appointed
      lieutenant-colonel: "He recognized me the first time we met; I saw he was
      grown into a fine-looking officer; and indeed, Mr. Harrington, I saw him,
      without bearing the least malice for any little things that had passed,
      which I thought, as you say, were only schoolboy follies. But in a few
      minutes I found, to my sorrow, that he was not changed in mind towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His first words at meeting me in the public streets were, 'So! are you
      here, <i>young Shylock?</i> What brings you to Gibraltar? You are of the
      tribe of Gad, I think, <i>thou Wandering Jew!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Mowbray's servants heard, and caught their lord's witticism: the
      serjeants and soldiers repeated the colonel's words, and the nicknames
      spread through the regiment, and through the garrison; wherever I turned,
      I heard them echoed: poor Jacob was called <i>young Shylock</i> by some,
      and by others the <i>Wandering Jew</i>. It was a bitter jest, and soon
      became bitter earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ignorant soldiers really believed me to be that Jew whom Christians
      most abominate. [Footnote: See Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry, for the
      ballad of the Wandering Jew.]
    </p>
    <p>
      "The common people felt a superstitious dread of me: the mothers charged
      their children to keep out of my way; and if I met them in the streets,
      they ran away and hid themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may think, sir, I was not happy. I grew melancholy; and my melancholy
      countenance, they said, was a proof that I was what I was said to be. I
      was ashamed to show my face. I lost all relish for my food, and began to
      pine away. My master noticed it, and he was sorry for me; he took my part,
      and spoke to the young lord, who thereupon grew angry, and high words
      passed; the young lord cursed at my master for an insolent Jew dog. As to
      me, his lordship swore that he knew me from a boy; that he had known
      enough of my tricks, and that of course for that I must bear him malice;
      and he vowed I should not bear it to him for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From that day there was a party raised against us in the garrison. Lord
      Mowbray's soldiers of course took his part; and those who were most his
      favourites abused us the most. They never passed our store any day without
      taunt and insult; ever repeating the names their colonel had given me. It
      was hard to stand still and mute, and bear every thing, without reply. But
      I was determined not to bring my master into any quarrel, so I bore all.
      Presently the time came when there was great distress for provisions in
      the garrison; then the cry against the Jews was terrible: but I do not
      wish to say more of what followed than is necessary to my own story. You
      must have heard, sir, of the riot at Gibraltar, the night when the
      soldiery broke into the spirit stores?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I had read accounts of some such thing in the newspapers of the day; I had
      heard of excesses committed by the soldiery, who were enraged against the
      Jew merchants; and I recollected some story [Footnote: Drinkwater's Siege
      of Gibraltar.] of the soldiers having roasted a pig before a Jew's door,
      with a fire made of the Jew's own cinnamon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fire, sir," said Jacob, "was made before our door: it was kindled by
      a party of Lord Mowbray's soldiers, who, madly intoxicated with the
      spirits they had taken from the stores, came in the middle of that
      dreadful night to our house, and with horrible shouts, called upon my
      master to give up to them the <i>Wandering Jew</i>. My master refusing to
      do this, they burst open his house, pillaged, wasted, destroyed, and burnt
      all before our eyes! We lost every thing! I do not mean to say <i>we&mdash;I</i>,
      poor Jacob, had little to lose. It is not of that, though it was my all,
      it is not of that I speak&mdash;but my master! From a rich man in one hour
      he became a beggar! The fruit of all his labour lost&mdash;nothing left
      for his wife or children! I never can forget his face of despair by that
      fire-light. I think I see it now! He did not recover it, sir,&mdash;he
      died of a broken heart. He was the best and kindest of masters to me. And
      can you wonder now, Mr. Harrington, or do you blame Jacob, that he could
      not look upon that lord with a pleased eye, nor smile when he saw him
      again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not blame Jacob&mdash;I liked him for the warmth of his feeling for
      his master. When he was a little composed, however, I represented that his
      affection and pity might have raised his indignation too strongly, and
      might have made him impute to Lord Mowbray a greater share than he really
      had in their misfortunes. Lord Mowbray was a very young officer at that
      time, too young to be trusted with the command of men in such difficult
      circumstances. His lordship had been exceedingly blamable in giving, even
      in jest, the nicknames which had prejudiced his soldiers against an
      innocent individual; but I could not conceive that he had a serious design
      to injure; nor could he, as I observed, possibly foresee the fatal
      consequences that afterwards ensued. As to the excesses of his soldiers,
      for their want of discipline he was answerable; but Jacob should recollect
      the distress to which the soldiers had been previously reduced, and the
      general prejudice against those who were supposed to be the cause of the
      scarcity. Lord Mowbray might be mistaken like others; but as to his
      permitting their outrages, or directing them against individual Jews whom
      he disliked, I told Jacob it was impossible for me to believe it. Why did
      not the Jew merchant state his complaint to the general, who had, as Jacob
      allowed, punished all the soldiers who had been convicted of committing
      outrages? If Lord Mowbray had been complained of by Mr. Manessa, a
      court-martial would have been held; and if the charges had been
      substantiated, his title of colonel or lord would have availed him nothing&mdash;he
      would have been broke. Jacob said, his poor master, who was ruined and in
      despair, thought not of courts-martial&mdash;perhaps he had no legal
      proofs&mdash;perhaps he dreaded, with reason, the popular prejudice in the
      garrison, and dared not, being a Jew, appear against a Christian officer.
      How that might have been, Jacob said, he did not know&mdash;all he knew
      was that his master was very ill, and that he returned to England soon
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, argued I, if Lord Mowbray had not been brought to a
      court-martial, if it had been known among his brother officers that he had
      been guilty of such unofficer-like conduct, no British officer would have
      kept company with him. I was therefore convinced that Jacob must have been
      misinformed and deceived by exaggerated reports, and prejudiced by the
      warmth of his own feelings for the loss of his master. Jacob listened to
      me with a look of incredulity, yet as if with a wish to believe that I was
      right: he softened gradually&mdash;he struggled with his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knew," he said, "that it was our Christian precept to forgive our
      enemies&mdash;a very good precept: but was it easy? Did all Christians
      find it easy to put it in practice? And you, Mr. Harrington, you who can
      have no enemies, how can you judge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob ended by promising, with a smile, that he would show me that a Jew
      could forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, eager to discard the subject, he spoke of other things. I thanked
      him for his having introduced me to Mr. Israel Lyons:&mdash;he was
      delighted to hear of the advantage I had derived from this introduction at
      Cambridge, and of its having led to my acquaintance with Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been informed of my meeting Miss Montenero at the theatre: and he
      told me of his hopes and fears when he heard her say she had been assisted
      by a gentleman of the name of Harrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not venture, however, to speak much of Miss Montenero; but I
      expatiated on the pleasure I had in Mr. Montenero's conversation, and on
      the advantages I hoped to derive from cultivating his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob, always more disposed to affection and gratitude than to suspicion
      or revenge, seemed happy to be relieved from the thoughts of Lord Mowbray,
      and he appeared inspired with fresh life and spirit when he talked of Mr.
      Montenero and his daughter. He mentioned their kindness to the widow and
      children of his deceased master, and of Mr. Montenero's goodness to the
      surviving brother and partner, the London jeweller, Mr. Manessa, Jacob's
      first benefactor. The Manessas had formerly been settled in Spain, at the
      time Mr. Montenero had lived there; and when he was in some difficulties
      with the Inquisition, they had in some way essentially served him, either
      in assisting his escape from that country, or in transmitting his
      property. Jacob was not acquainted with the particulars, but he knew that
      Mr. Montenero was most grateful for the obligation, whatever it had been;
      and now that he was rich and the Manessas in distress, he seemed to think
      he could never do enough for them. Jacob became first acquainted, as he
      told me, with Mr. Montenero in consequence of his connexion with this
      family. The widow had represented him as being a faithful friend, and the
      two children of his deceased master were fond of him. Mr. Montenero's
      attachment to the Manessas immediately made him take notice of Jacob.
      Jacob told me that he was to go to their house in the city, and to take
      charge of their affairs, as soon as they could be settled; and that Mr.
      Montenero had promised if possible to obtain for him a share in the firm
      of the surviving brother and partner. In the mean time Jacob was employed
      by Mr. Montenero in making out catalogues of his books and pictures,
      arranging his library and cabinet of medals, &amp;c., to all which he was
      fully competent. Jacob said he rejoiced that these occupations would keep
      him a little while longer at Mr. Montenero's, as he should there have more
      frequent opportunities of seeing me, than he could hope for when he should
      be at the other end of the town. "Besides," added he, "I don't know how I
      shall ever be able to do without the kindness Mr. Montenero shows me; and
      as for Miss Montenero&mdash;!" Jacob's countenance expanded, and his voice
      was by turns softened into tenderness, and raised to enthusiasm, as he
      again spoke of the father and daughter: and when my mind was touched and
      warmed by his panegyric of Berenice&mdash;pronounced with the true
      eloquence of the heart&mdash;she, leaning on her father's arm, entered the
      room. The dignified simplicity, the graceful modesty of her appearance, so
      unlike the fashionable forwardness or the fashionable bashfulness, or any
      of the various airs of affectation, which I had seen in Lady Anne Mowbray
      and her class of young ladies, charmed me perhaps the more from contrast
      and from the novelty of the charm. There was a timid sensibility in her
      countenance when I spoke to her, which joined to the feminine reserve of
      her whole manner, the tone of her voice, and the propriety and elegance of
      the very little she said, pleased me inexpressibly. I wished only that she
      had said more. However, when her father spoke, it seemed to be almost the
      same as if she spoke herself&mdash;her sympathy with him appeared so
      strongly. He began by speaking of Jacob: he was glad to find that I was <i>the</i>
      Mr. Harrington whom Jacob had been so eager to see. It was evident that
      they knew all the good that grateful young man could tell of me; and the
      smile which I received from the father and daughter at this instant would
      have overpaid me for any obligations I could have conferred. Jacob
      retired, observing that he had taken up all the time with the history of
      his own private affairs, and that I had not yet seen any of the pictures.
      Mr. Montenero immediately led me to one of Murillo's, regretting that he
      had not the pleasure of showing it to my mother. I began to speak of her
      sorrow at not being able to venture out; I made some apology, but whatever
      it was, I am sure I did not, I could not, pronounce it well. Mr. Montenero
      bowed his head courteously, removed his eyes from my face, and glanced for
      one moment at Miss Montenero with a look of regret, quickly succeeded by
      an expression in his countenance of calm and proud independence. He was
      sorry, he said, that he could not have the honour of seeing Mrs.
      Harrington&mdash;the pleasure of presenting his daughter to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that he was aware of what I had hoped had escaped his
      penetration&mdash;my mother's prepossession against him and his daughter.
      I saw that he attributed it to a general prejudice against his race and
      religion, and I perceived that this hurt his feelings much, though his
      pride or his philosophy quickly repressed his sensibility. He never
      afterwards spoke of my mother&mdash;never hoped to see her another day&mdash;nor
      hoped even that the cold, which had prevented her from venturing out,
      would be better. I was the more vexed and ashamed that I had not been able
      to bring my mother with me. I turned the conversation as quickly as I
      could to Mr. Israel Lyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed, by what Mr. Montenero said, that from the information he had
      received from Mr. Lyons and from Jacob, he was thoroughly aware of my
      early prejudices and antipathy to the Jews. He observed to his daughter,
      that Mr. Harrington had double merit in his present liberality, since he
      had conquered what it is so difficult, scarcely possible, completely to
      conquer&mdash;an early prepossession, fostered perhaps by the opinion of
      many who must have had great influence on his mind. Through this
      compliment, I thought I saw in Mr. Montenero's, and still more in the
      timid countenance of his daughter, a fear that I might relapse; and that
      <i>these early prepossessions, which were so difficult, scarcely possible,
      completely to conquer</i>, might recur. I promised myself that I should
      soon convince them they were mistaken, if they had formed any such notion,
      and I was flattered by the fear, as it implied that I had inspired some
      interest. We went on with the pictures. Not being a connoisseur, though
      fond of the arts, I was relieved and pleased to find that Mr. Montenero
      had none of the jargon of connoisseurship: while his observations
      impressed me with a high idea of his taste and judgment, they gave me some
      confidence in my own. I was delighted to find that I understood, and could
      naturally and truly agree with all he said, and that my untutored
      preferences were what they ought to be, according to the right rules of
      art and science. In short, I was proud to find that my taste was in
      general the same as his and his daughter's. What pleased me far more than
      Mr. Montenero's taste, was the liberality and the enlargement of mind I
      saw in all his opinions and sentiments. There was in him a philosophic
      calmness and moderation; his reason seemed to have worked against great
      natural sensibility, perhaps susceptibility, till this calm had become the
      unvarying temper of his mind. I fancied, also, that I perceived a constant
      care in him to cultivate the same temper in his daughter, and to fortify
      her against that extreme sensibility to the opinion of others, and that
      diffidence of herself, to which, as I recollected, he had formerly
      adverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having admired some of Murillo's pictures, we came to one which I,
      unpractised as I was in judging of painting, immediately perceived to be
      inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right," said Mr. Montenero; "it is inferior to Murillo, and
      the sudden sense of this inferiority absolutely broke the painter's heart.
      This picture is by a painter of the name of Castillo, who had thought
      comfortably well of himself, till he saw the master-pieces of Murillo's
      genius; Castillo surveyed them for some time in absolute silence, then
      turning away, exclaimed <i>Castillo is no more!</i> and soon Castillo was
      no more. From that moment he pined away, and shortly afterwards died: not
      from envy," continued Mr. Montenero; "no, he was a man of mild, amiable
      temper, incapable of envy; but he fell a victim to excessive sensibility&mdash;a
      dangerous, though not a common vice of character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weakness, not vice, I hope," I heard Miss Montenero say in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father answered with a sigh, "<i>that</i>, however, cannot be called a
      virtue, which incapacitates from the exercise of independent virtue, and
      which, as you find, not only depresses genius, but may extinguish life
      itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero then turned to me, and with composure went on speaking of
      the pictures. Ever since I knew I was to see these, I had been studying
      Cumberland's Lives of the Spanish Painters, and this I honestly told Mr.
      Montenero, when he complimented me upon my knowing all the names and
      anecdotes to which he alluded: he smiled&mdash;so did his daughter; and he
      was so good as to say that he liked me better for telling him this so
      candidly, than if I had known all that the connoisseurs and
      anecdote-mongers, living or dead, had ever said or written. We came to a
      picture by Alonzo Cano, who, excelling in architecture, statuary, and
      painting, has been called the Michael Angelo of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He at least was not deficient in a comfortably good opinion of himself,
      Mr. Montenero," said I. "Is not it recorded of Cano, that having finished
      a statue of Saint Antonio de Padua for a Spanish counsellor, the tasteless
      lawyer and niggardly devotee hesitated to pay the artist his price,
      observing that Cano, by his own account, had been only twenty-five days
      about it? The counsellor sat down, with stupid self-sufficiency, to
      calculate, that at a hundred pistoles, divided by twenty-five days, the
      artist would be paid at a higher rate than he was himself for the exercise
      of his talents. 'Wretch! talk to me of your talents!' exclaimed the
      enraged artist; 'I have been fifty years learning to make this statue in
      twenty-five days!' And as he spoke, Cano dashed his statue to pieces on
      the pavement of the academy. The affrighted counsellor fled from the house
      with the utmost precipitation, concluding that the man who was bold enough
      to destroy a saint, would have very little remorse in destroying a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happily for Cano, this story did not reach the ears of the Inquisition,"
      said Mr. Montenero, "or he would have been burnt alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero then pointed out some exquisite pieces by this artist, and
      spoke with enthusiasm of his genius. I perceived some emotion, of which I
      could not guess the cause, in the countenance of his daughter; she seemed
      touched by what her father said about this painter or his pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero concluded his panegyric on Cano's genius by saying, "Besides
      being a great genius, we are told that he was very religious, and, some
      few peculiarities excepted, very charitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very charitable, I am sure," said Miss Montenero, looking at her
      father, and smiling: "I am not sure that I could speak so charitably of
      that man." A sigh quickly followed her smile, and I now recollected having
      heard or read that this painter bore such an antipathy to the Jews, that
      he considered every touch of theirs as contamination; and, if he
      accidentally came in contact with them, would cast off and give away his
      clothes, forbidding the servant to whom he gave them, on any account to
      wear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Montenero saw that I recollected to what she alluded&mdash;that I had
      a just feeling of the benevolent magnanimity of her father's character.
      This raised me, I perceived, in the daughter's opinion. Though scarcely a
      word passed at the moment, yet I fancied that we felt immediately better
      acquainted. I ventured to go and stand beside her, from doing which I had
      hitherto been prevented by I know not what insurmountable difficulty or
      strange spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were both opposite to a Spanish copy of Guido's Aurora Surgens. I
      observed that the flame of the torch borne by the winged boy, representing
      Lucifer, points westward, in a direction contrary to that in which the
      manes of the horses, the drapery of Apollo, and that of the dancing Hours,
      are blown, which seemed to me to be a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice said that Guido had taken this picture from Ovid's description,
      and that he had, with great art, represented, by the very circumstance to
      which I objected, the swiftness of the motion with which the chariot was
      driven forward. The current of the morning wind blowing from the east was
      represented by the direction of the hair of Lucifer, and of the flame of
      his torch; while the rapidity of the motion of the chariot was such, that,
      notwithstanding the eastern wind, which would otherwise have blown them
      towards the west, the manes of the horses, and the drapery of the figures,
      were driven backwards, by the resistance of the air against which they
      were hurried. She then repeated, in a pleasing but timid manner, in
      support of her opinion, these two beautiful lines of Addison's
      translation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "With winged speed outstrips the eastern wind,
    And leaves the breezes of the morn behind."
</pre>
    <p>
      I need not say that I was delighted with this criticism, and with the
      modest manner in which it was spoken: but I could not honestly help
      remarking that, to the description immediately alluded to in Ovid, Addison
      had added the second beautiful line,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "And leaves the breezes of the morn behind."
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero looked pleased, and said to me, "It is very true, in the
      immediate passage describing the chariot of the Sun issuing from the gates
      of Heaven, this line is not in the original; but if you look further back
      in the fable, you will find that the idea is still more strongly expressed
      in the Latin than in the English."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with the utmost difficulty that I at last forced myself away, nor
      was I in the least aware of the unconscionable length of my visit. What
      particularly pleased me in the conversation of Miss Montenero was, that
      she had none of those fashionable phrases which fill each vacuity of
      sense, and which level all distinctions of understanding. There was none
      of that commonplace stuff which passes for conversation in the world, and
      which we hear and repeat till we are equally tired of others and of
      ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, besides, in her manner and countenance, indications of perfect
      sweetness of temper, a sort of feminine gentleness and softness which art
      cannot feign nor affectation counterfeit; a gentleness which, while it is
      the charm of female manners, is perfectly consistent with true spirit, and
      with the higher or the stronger qualities of the mind. All I had seen of
      Miss Montenero in this first visit inspired me with the most ardent desire
      to see more. Here was a woman who could fill my whole soul; who could at
      once touch my heart and my imagination. I felt inspired with new life&mdash;I
      had now a great object, a strong and lively interest in existence. At
      parting, Mr. Montenero shook hands with me, which, he said, he knew was
      the English mode of showing kindness: he expressed an earnest, but proudly
      guarded wish, that I might be <i>so circumstanced</i>, and so inclined, as
      to allow him the pleasure he much desired, of cultivating my acquaintance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The interest which Berenice inspired, so completely absorbed my mind, that
      I never thought again of Jacob and his story, till I met Lady Anne and her
      brother the next morning, when I went to take a ride in the park: they
      were with Colonel Topham, and some people of her ladyship's acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne, after the usual preliminary quantity of nonsense, and after she
      had questioned and cross-questioned me, to the best of her slender
      abilities, about the Jewess, told me a long story about herself, and her
      fears, and the fears of her mare, and a horse-laugh of Mowbray's which
      Colonel Topham said no horse could stand: not much applause ensuing from
      me, she returned to the witty colonel, and left me to her brother. Mowbray
      directly began to talk about Jacob. He said he supposed Jacob had not
      failed to make his Gibraltar story good; but that "Hear both sides" was an
      indispensable maxim, even where such a favourite as Jacob was concerned.
      "But first let us take one other good gallop," said Mowbray; "Anne, I
      leave you here with Mrs. Carrill and Colonel Topham;" and away he
      galloped. When he thought, as he said, that he had shaken off some of my
      prejudices, he drew up his horse, and talked over the Gibraltar affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dashing, jocular, military mode of telling the thing, so different
      from Jacob's plain, mercantile, matter-of-fact method, quite changed my
      view and opinion of the transaction. Mowbray blamed himself with such a
      good grace, and wished so fervently that he could make any reparation to
      "the poor devils who had suffered," that I acquitted him of all malice,
      and forgave his imprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frankness with which he spoke to Jacob, when they met, was proof
      conclusive to me that he was incapable, as he declared, of harbouring any
      malice against Jew or Christian. He inquired most particularly into
      Jacob's own losses at Gibraltar, called for pen, ink, and paper, and in
      his off-hand manner wrote a draft on his banker, and put it into Jacob's
      hand. "Here, my honest Jacob, you are a Jew whose accounts I can take at
      your word. Let this settle the balance between us. No scruples, Jacob&mdash;no
      present, this&mdash;nothing but remuneration for your losses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob accepted Lord Mowbray's apologies, but could not by any means be
      prevailed upon to accept from him any present or remuneration. He seemed
      willing to forgive, but not to trust Lord Mowbray. All trace of resentment
      was cleared from his countenance, but no condescension of his lordship
      could move Jacob to throw off his reserve beyond a certain point. He
      conquered aversion, but he would not pretend to like. Mr. Montenero came
      into the room while we were speaking, and I presented Lord Mowbray to him.
      There was as marked a difference as politeness would allow in Mr.
      Montenero's manner towards his lordship and towards me, which I justly
      attributed to Jacob's previous representations. We looked at the pictures,
      and talked, and loitered, but I turned my eyes in vain to the door every
      time it opened&mdash;no Miss Montenero appeared. I was so much preoccupied
      with my object that I was silent, and left Mowbray to make his own way,
      which no one was more capable of doing. In a few minutes he was in full
      conversation. He went over again, without my attending to it, his <i>pice
      justificative</i> about the riot at Gibraltar, and Jacob, and the
      Manessas; and between the fits of my reverie, I perceived Mowbray was
      talking of the Due de Crillon and General Elliot, and red-hot balls; but I
      took no interest in the conversation, till I heard him speak of an
      officers' ball at Gibraltar, and of dancing with a Jewess. The very night
      he had first landed at Gibraltar, there happened to be a ball to which he
      went with a friend, who was also just landed, and a stranger. It was the
      custom to draw lots for partners. His friend, a true-born Englishman, took
      fright at the foreign-sounding name of the lady who fell to his lot&mdash;Mowbray
      changed tickets with him, and had, he said, great reason to rejoice. The
      lady with the foreign name was a Jewess, the handsomest, the most
      graceful, the most agreeable woman in the room. He was the envy of every
      man, and especially of his poor friend, who too late repented his rash
      renunciation of his ticket. Lord Mowbray, by several other slight
      anecdotes, which he introduced with happy effect, contrived to please Mr.
      Montenero; and if any unfavourable prepossession had existed against him,
      it was, I thought, completely removed. For my own part, I was delighted
      with his presence of mind in recollecting all that was best worth seeing
      in London, and arranging parties in which we could have the honour of
      attending Miss Montenero, and the pleasure of being of some use to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero's own acquaintance in London was chiefly with the families
      of some of the foreign ambassadors, and with other foreigners of
      distinction; but his daughter was not yet acquainted with any English
      ladies, except the lady of General B&mdash;&mdash;, with whom the
      Monteneros had been intimate in America. Lady Emily B&mdash;&mdash; was
      detained in the country by the illness of one of her family, and Miss
      Montenero, having declined going into public with Mrs. Coates, would wait
      quietly at home till her English friends should come to town. Again shame
      for my mother's remissness obliged me to cast down my eyes in awkward
      silence. But Mowbray, Heaven bless him for it! went on fluently. This was
      the moment, he said, before Miss Montenero should appear in public, and
      get into the whirl of the great world, before engagements should multiply
      and press upon her, as inevitably they would as soon as she had made her
      dbut&mdash;this was the moment, and the only moment probably she would
      ever have to herself, to see all that was worth a stranger's notice in
      London. Mr. Montenero was obliged to Mowbray, and I am sure so was I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Montenero, infinitely more desirous to see than to be seen, was
      pleased with the parties we arranged for her and from this time forward,
      scarcely a day passed without our having the pleasure of attending the
      father and daughter. My mother sighed and remonstrated in vain; my father,
      absorbed in the House of Commons, was satisfied with seeing me regularly
      at breakfast. He usually dined at clubs, and it was happily his principle
      to let his son amuse himself his own way. But I assured her, and truly,
      that I was only amusing myself, and that I had not formed any serious
      intentions. I wished to see more of the lady. Mowbray, with ready
      invention, continually suggested something particularly well worth seeing
      or hearing, some delightful pretext for our being together. Sometimes he
      accompanied us, sometimes he excused himself&mdash;he had indispensable
      engagements. His <i>indispensable engagements</i> I knew were usually with
      ladies of a very different sort from Miss Montenero. Mowbray was
      desperately in love with the young actress who had played the part of
      Jessica, and to her he devoted every moment he could command. I regretted
      for his sake his dissipated tastes, but I felt the more obliged to him for
      the time he sacrificed to friendship; and perhaps, to tell things just as
      they were, I was glad he was safely in love with a Jessica of his own, as
      it secured me from all apprehension of his rivalling or wishing to rival
      me. Miss Montenero he confessed was not in the least to his taste. In this
      instance I was quite satisfied that our tastes should completely differ. I
      never liked him so well&mdash;we went on most happily together. I felt
      uncommonly benevolent towards the whole world; my heart expanded with
      increased affection for all my friends&mdash;every thing seemed to smile
      upon me&mdash;even the weather. The most delicious morning I ever remember
      was that on which we rowed along the banks of the Thames with Miss
      Montenero. I always enjoyed every beautiful object in nature with
      enthusiasm, but now with new delight&mdash;with all the enchantment of a
      first love, and of hope that had never known disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was almost angry with my dear friend Mowbray, for not being as
      enthusiastic this day as I was myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were certain points of taste and character on which we never could
      agree; my romantic imagination and enthusiastic manner of expressing
      myself, were often in contrast with his worldly comic mode of seeing and
      talking. He hurt, sometimes, my feelings by his raillery&mdash;he pulled
      me down too suddenly from my flights of imagination. By the flashes of his
      wit he showed, perhaps too clearly, the danger of my fall from "high
      sublime to deep absurd;" but, after all, I was satisfied that Miss
      Montenero preferred my style, and in general I was content that he should
      enjoy his dear wit and gay rhetoric&mdash;even a little at my expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning we went to Westminster Abbey, I own I was provoked with him,
      for pointing out to my observation, at the moment when my imagination was
      struck with the sense of sublimity at the sight of the awful pile, the
      ridiculous contrast of the showman and his keys, who was impatiently
      waiting till I had finished my exclamations; but I soon forgot both the
      showman and the wit, while at every step, among the illustrious dead, my
      enthusiasm was raised, and some anecdote of their lives, or some striking
      quotation from their works, rushed upon my mind. I was inspired and
      encouraged by the approbation of the father, and the sympathy of the
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were quitting the Abbey, Mr. Montenero stopped, turned to me, and
      said, "You have a great deal of enthusiasm, I see, Mr. Harrington: so much
      the better, in my opinion&mdash;I love generous enthusiasm."
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the moment I flattered myself that the eyes of his daughter
      repeated "I love generous enthusiasm," her father caught the expression,
      and immediately, with his usual care, moderated and limited what he had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enthusiasm well governed, of course, I mean&mdash;as one of your English
      noblemen lately said, 'There is an enthusiasm of the head, and that is
      genius&mdash;there is an enthusiasm of the heart, and that is virtue&mdash;there
      is an enthusiasm of the temper, and that is&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Montenero looked uneasy, and her father perceiving this, checked
      himself again, and, changing his tone, added, "But with all its dangers
      and errors, enthusiasm, in either man or woman, is more amiable and
      respectable than selfishness. Enthusiasm is not the vice of the young men
      or women of the present day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Mowbray, who was now very attentive to every thing
      that passed. I forgave him the witticisms with which he had crossed my
      humour this morning, for the kind sympathy he showed with the pleasure I
      felt at this moment. Afterwards, when Mowbray and I were alone together,
      and <i>compared notes</i>, as we were in the habit of doing, upon all that
      had been said, and had been looked, during the day, Mowbray congratulated
      me upon the impression I had made by my eloquence. "Enthusiasm, you see,
      is the thing both with father and daughter: you succeed in that line&mdash;follow
      it up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I was incapable of affecting enthusiasm, or of acting any part to show
      myself off; yet Mowbray's opinion and my own observations coinciding,
      unconsciously and involuntarily, I afterwards became more at my ease in
      yielding to my natural feelings and habitual expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Montenero had not yet seen the Tower, and Mowbray engaged himself to
      be of our party. But at the same time, he privately begged me to keep it a
      dead secret from his sister. Lady Anne, he said, would never cease to
      ridicule him, if she were to hear of his going to the Tower, after having
      been too lazy to go with her, and all the fashionable world, the night
      before, to the Fantoccini.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I had lived in London half my childhood, my nervous disease had
      prevented my being taken to see even the sights that children are usually
      shown; and since my late arrival in town, when I had been my own master,
      engagements and emotions had pressed upon me too fast to leave time or
      inclination to think of such things. My object, of course, was now merely
      to have the pleasure of accompanying Berenice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was unexpectedly struck, on entering the armoury at the Tower. The
      walls, three hundred feet in length, covered with arms for two hundred
      thousand men, burnished arms, glittering in fancy figures on the walls,
      and ranged in endless piles from the ceiling to the floor of that long
      gallery; then the apartment with the line of ancient kings, clad in
      complete armour, mounted on their steeds fully caparisoned&mdash;the
      death-like stiffness of the figures&mdash;the stillness&mdash;the silence
      of the place&mdash;altogether awe the imagination, and carry the memory
      back to the days of chivalry. When among these forms of kings and heroes
      who had ceased to be, I beheld the Black Prince, lance couched, vizor
      down, with the arms he wore at Cressy and Poictiers, my enthusiasm knew no
      bounds. The Black Prince, from my childhood, had been the object of my
      idolatry. I kneeled&mdash;I am ashamed to confess it&mdash;to do homage to
      the empty armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero, past the age of romantic extravagance, could not sympathize
      with this enthusiasm, but he bore with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed on to dark Gothic nooks of chambers, where my reverence for the
      beds on which kings had slept, and the tables at which kings had sat, much
      increased by my early associations formed of Brantefield Priory, was
      expressed with a vehemence which astonished Mr. Montenero; and, I fear,
      prevented him from hearing the answers to various inquiries, upon which
      he, with better regulated judgment, was intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      An orator is the worst person to tell a plain fact; the very worst guide,
      as Mowbray observed, that a foreigner can have. Still Mr. Montenero had
      patience with me, and supplied the elisions in my rhetoric, by what
      information he could pick up from the guide, and from Mowbray, with whom,
      from time to time, he stopped to see and hear, after I had passed on with
      Berenice. To her quickness and sympathy I flattered myself that I was
      always intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came at last to the chamber where Clarence and the young princes had
      been murdered. Here, I am conscious, I was beyond measure exuberant in
      exclamations, and in quotations from Shakspeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero came in just as I was ranting, from Clarence's dream&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seize on him, furies! take him to your torments!&mdash;With that,
      methought, a legion of foul fiends Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such hideous cries! that with the very noise I made, I prevented poor Mr.
      Montenero from hearing the answer to some historic question he was asking.
      Berenice's eye warned me to lower my voice, and I believe I should have
      been quiet, but that unluckily, Mowbray set me off in another direction,
      by reminding me of the tapestry-chamber and Sir Josseline. I remember
      covering my face with both my hands, and shuddering with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero asked, "What of the tapestry-chamber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And immediately recollecting that I should not, to him, and before his
      daughter, describe the Jew, who had committed a deed without a name, I
      with much embarrassment said, that "it was nothing of any consequence&mdash;it
      was something I could not explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      I left it to Mowbray's superior presence of mind, and better address, to
      account for it, and I went on with Berenice. Whenever my imagination was
      warmed, verses poured in upon my memory, and often without much apparent
      connexion with what went before. I recollected at this moment the passage
      in Akenside's "Pleasures of the Imagination" describing the early delight
      the imagination takes in horrors:&mdash;the children closing round the
      village matron, who suspends the infant audience with her tales breathing
      astonishment; and I recited all I recollected of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Evil spirits! of the deathbed call
    Of him who robb'd the widow, and devour'd
    The orphan's portion&mdash;of unquiet souls
    Ris'n from the grave, to ease the heavy guilt
    Of deeds in life conceal'd&mdash;of shapes that walk
    At dead of night, and clank their chains, and wave
    The torch of Hell around the murderer's bed!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Mowbray and Mr. Montenero, who had stayed behind us a few minutes, came up
      just as I was, with much emphasis and gesticulation,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Waving the torch of Hell."
</pre>
    <p>
      I am sure I must have been a most ridiculous figure. I saw Mowbray on the
      brink of laughter; but Mr. Montenero looked so grave, that he fixed all my
      attention. I suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were talking of 'The Pleasures of Imagination,'" said Berenice to her
      father. "Mr. Harrington is a great admirer of Akenside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he?" replied Mr. Montenero coldly, and with a look of absence. "But,
      my dear, we can have the pleasures of the imagination another time. Here
      are some realities worthy of our present attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then drew his daughter's arm within his. I followed; and all the time
      he was pointing out to her the patterns of the Spanish instruments of
      torture, with which her politic majesty Queen Elizabeth frightened her
      subjects into courage sufficient to repel all the invaders on board the
      invincible armada&mdash;I stood silent, pondering on what I might have
      said or done to displease him whom I was so anxious to please. First, I
      thought he suspected me of what I most detested, the affectation of taste,
      sensibility, and enthusiasm; next, I fancied that Mowbray, in explaining
      about the tapestry-chamber, Sir Josseline, and the bastinadoed Jew, had
      said something that might have hurt Mr. Montenero's Jewish pride. From
      whichever of these causes his displeasure arose, it had the effect of
      completely sobering my spirits. My poetic fit was over. I did not even
      dare to speak to his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our drive home, Berenice, apropos to something which Mowbray had
      said, but which I did not hear, suggested to her father some lines of
      Akenside, which she knew he particularly admired, on the nature and power
      of the early association of ideas. Mr. Montenero, with all the warmth my
      heart could wish, praised the poetic genius, and the intimate and deep
      knowledge of the human mind displayed in this passage. His gravity
      gradually wore off, and I began to doubt whether the displeasure had ever
      existed. At night, before Mowbray and I parted, when we talked over the
      day, he assured me that he had said nothing that could make Mr. Montenero
      displeased with me or any living creature; that they had been discussing
      some point of English History, on which old Montenero had posed him. As to
      my fears, Mowbray rallied me out of them effectually. He maintained that
      Montenero had not been at all displeased, and that I was a most absurd <i>modern
      self-tormentor.</i> "Could not a man look grave for two minutes without my
      racking my fancy for two hours to find a cause for it? Perhaps the man had
      the toothache; possibly the headache; but why should I, therefore, insist
      upon having the heartache?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mowbray's indifference was often a happy relief to my anxiety of temper;
      and I had surely reason to be grateful to him for the sacrifices he
      continued daily to make of his own tastes and pleasures, to forward my
      views.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning in particular, he was going to a rehearsal at Drury-lane,
      where I knew his heart was; but finding me very anxious to go to the Mint
      and the Bank with Mr. Montenero and Berenice, Mowbray, who had a relation
      a Bank director, immediately offered to accompany us, and procured us the
      means of seeing every thing in the best possible manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could, as he confessed, be less to his taste; and he was surprised
      that Miss Montenero chose to be of the party. A day spent in viewing the
      Mint and the Bank, it may perhaps be thought, was a day lost to love&mdash;quite
      the contrary; I had an opportunity of feeling how the passion of love can
      throw its enchantment over scenes apparently least adapted to its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this time I had twice gone over every part of these magnificent
      establishments. I had seen at the Bank the spirit of order operating like
      predestination, compelling the will of man to act necessarily and
      continually with all the precision of mechanism. I had beheld human
      creatures, called clerks, turned nearly into arithmetical machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how new did it all appear in looking at it with Berenice! How would
      she have been delighted if she had seen those machines, "instinct with
      spirit," which now perform the most delicate manoeuvres with more than
      human dexterity&mdash;the self-moving balance which indefatigably weighs,
      accepts, rejects, disposes of the coin, which a mimic hand perpetually
      presents!
    </p>
    <p>
      What chiefly pleased me in Miss Montenero was the composure, the <i>sincerity</i>
      of her attention. She was not anxious to display herself: I was the more
      delighted when I discovered her quickness of comprehension. I was charmed
      too by the unaffected pleasure she showed in acquiring new ideas, and
      surprised by the judicious <i>proportion</i> of the admiration she
      expressed for all that was in various degrees excellent in arrangement, or
      ingenious in contrivance: in short....
    </p>
    <p>
      "In short, man," as Mowbray would say, "in short, man, you were in love,
      and there's an end of the matter: if your Berenice had hopped forty paces
      in the public streets, it would have been the same with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      That I deny&mdash;but I will go on with my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were going away, Mr. Montenero, after thanking Lord Mowbray and his
      cousin, the Bank director, who had shown and explained every thing to us
      with polite and intelligent patience, observed that the Bank was to him a
      peculiarly interesting sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," said he, "that we Jews were the first inventors of bills of
      exchange and bank-notes&mdash;we were originally the bankers and brokers
      of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as we walked to the carriage, he continued addressing himself to his
      daughter, in a lowered voice, "You see, Berenice, here, as in a thousand
      instances, how general and permanent good often results from partial and
      temporary evil. The persecutions even to which we Jews were exposed&mdash;the
      tyranny which drove us from place to place, and from country to country,
      at a moment's or without a moment's warning, compelled us, by necessity,
      to the invention of a happy expedient, by which we could convert all our
      property into a scrap of paper, that could be carried unseen in a
      pocket-book, or conveyed in a letter unsuspected."
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice thanked Heaven that the times of persecution were over; and
      added, that she hoped any prejudice which still existed would soon die
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray exclaimed against the very idea of the existence of such
      prejudices at this time of day in England, among the higher classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not recollect his own mother, I believe, when he said this; but I
      know I had a twinge of conscience about mine, and I did not dare to look
      at Mr. Montenero; nor did I know well which way to look, when his
      lordship, persisting in his assertion, asked Miss Montenero if she could
      possibly imagine that any such vulgar prejudices existed among well-bred
      persons. Berenice mildly answered, that she had really as yet enjoyed so
      few opportunities of seeing the higher classes of society in London that
      she could not form a judgment. She was willing to take upon trust his
      lordship's opinion, who must have means of knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I imagined that Mr. Montenero's eye was upon me, and that he was thinking
      of my mother's never having made the slightest advance towards an
      acquaintance with his daughter. I recollected the speeches I had made on
      his first visit, pledging my mother to that which she had never performed.
      I felt upon the rack&mdash;and a pause, that ensued afterwards, increased
      my misery. I longed for somebody to say something&mdash;any thing. I
      looked for assistance to Mowbray. He repeated, confidently, that Miss
      Montenero might entirely rely upon what he said as to London and England&mdash;indeed
      he had been a good deal abroad <i>too</i>. He seemed to be glad to get to
      the continent again&mdash;I followed him as fast as I could, and inquired
      whether he did not think that the French and Germans were much improved in
      liberality, and a spirit of toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me leave," said Mr. Montenero, "to answer for the improvement of the
      Germans. Fifteen years ago, I remember, when I was travelling in Germany,
      I was stopped at a certain bridge over the Rhine, and, being a Jew, was
      compelled to pay rather an ignominious toll. The Jews were there classed
      among cloven-footed beasts, and as such paid toll. But, within these few
      years, sixteen German princes, enlightened and inspired by one great
      writer, and one good minister, have combined to abolish this disgraceful
      tax. You see, my dear Berenice, your hope is quickly fulfilling&mdash;prejudices
      are dying away fast. Hope humbly, but hope always."
    </p>
    <p>
      The playful tone in which Mr. Montenero spoke, put me quite at my ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I was determined on an effort to make my mother acquainted
      with Miss Montenero. If I could but effect a meeting, a great point I
      thought would be gained. Mowbray undertook to manage it, and he, as usual,
      succeeded. He persuaded his mother to go to an auction of pictures, where
      he assured her she would be likely to meet with a Vandyke of one of her
      ancestors, of whose portrait she had long been in search. Lady de
      Brantefield engaged my mother to be of the party, without her having any
      suspicion that she would meet the Monteneros. We arrived in time to secure
      the best places, before the auction began. Neither Mr. nor Miss Montenero
      were there; but, to my utter discomfiture, a few minutes after we were
      seated, vulgar Mrs. Coates and all her tribe appeared. She elbowed her
      difficult way onward towards us, and nodding to me familiarly, seated
      herself and her Vandals on a line with us. Then, stretching herself across
      the august Lady de Brantefield, who drew back, far as space would permit,
      "Beg your pardon, ma'am, but I just want to say a word to this lady. A'n't
      you the lady&mdash;yes&mdash;that sat beside me at the play the other
      night&mdash;the Merchant of Venice and the Maid of the Oaks, was not it,
      Izzy? I hope you caught no cold, ma'am&mdash;you look but poorly, I am
      sorry to notice&mdash;but what I wanted to say, ma'am, here's an ivory fan
      Miss Montenero was in a pucker and quandary about." <i>Pucker and
      quandary!</i>&mdash;Oh! how I groaned inwardly!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in such a fuss about her, you know, sir, that I never found out,
      till I got home, I had pocketed a strange fan&mdash;here it is, ma'am, if
      it is yours&mdash;it's worth any body's owning, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fan was my mother's, and she was forced to be much obliged. Lady de
      Brantefield, still painfully holding back, did not resume her position
      till some seconds had elapsed after Mrs. Coates had withdrawn her fat bust&mdash;till
      it might be supposed that the danger of coming into contact with her was
      fairly over. My mother, after a decent interval, asked me if it were
      possible to move to some place where they could have more air, as the
      crowd was increasing. Lord Mowbray and I made way for her to a seat by an
      open window; but the persevering Mrs. Coates followed, talking about the
      famous elbows of Mr. Peter Coates, on whose arm she leaned. "When Peter
      chooses, there's not a man in Lon'on knows the use of his elbows better,
      and if we'd had him, Mr. Harrington, with us at the play, the other night,
      we should not have given you so much trouble with Miss Montenero, getting
      her out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mowbray, amused by my look of suffering, could not refrain from
      diverting himself further by asking a question or two about the
      Monteneros. It was soon apparent, from the manner in which Mrs. Coates
      answered, that she was not as well pleased with them as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her maxim, she said, to speak of the bridge as she went over it;
      and for her part, if she was to give her verdict, she couldn't but say
      Miss Montenero&mdash;for they weren't on terms to call her Miss Berry now&mdash;was
      a little incomprehensible sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of surprise from Lord Mowbray, without giving himself the trouble
      to articulate, was quite sufficient to make the lady go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, if it concerned any gentleman" (glancing her ill-bred eye upon me),
      "if any gentleman was thinking of looking that way, it might be of use to
      him to know the land. Miss Montenero, then, if truth must be told, is a
      little touchy on the Jewish chapter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mowbray urged Mrs. Coates on with "How, for instance?" "Oh, how! why,
      my lord, a hundred times I've hurt her to the quick. One can't always be
      thinking of people's different persuasions you know&mdash;and if one asked
      a question, just for information's sake, or made a natural remark, as I
      did t'other day, Queeney, you know, just about Jew butchers, and pigeons&mdash;'It's
      a pity,' said I, 'that Jews must always have Jew butchers, Miss Berry, and
      that there is so many things they can't touch: one can't have pigeons nor
      hares at one's table,' said I, thinking only of my second course; 'as to
      pork, Henny,' says I, 'that's a coarse butcher's meat, which I don't
      regret, nor the alderman, a pinch o' snuff'&mdash;now, you know, I thought
      that was kind of me; but Miss Montenero took it all the wrong way, quite
      to heart so, you've no idear! After all, she may say what she pleases, but
      it's my notion the Jews is both a very unsocial and a very revengeful
      people; for, do you know, my lord, they wouldn't dine with us next day,
      though the alderman called himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was so placed that she could not avoid hearing all that Mrs.
      Coates said to Lord Mowbray; and though she never uttered a syllable, or
      raised her eyes, or moved the fan she held in her hand, I knew by her
      countenance the impression that was made on her mind: she would have
      scorned, on any other subject of human life or manners, to have allowed
      the judgment of Mrs. Coates to weigh with her in the estimation of a
      single hair; yet here her opinion and <i>idears</i> were admitted to be
      decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is prejudice! thought I. Prejudice, even in the proudest people, will
      stoop to accept of nourishment from any hand. Prejudice not only grows on
      what it feeds upon, but converts every thing it meets with into
      nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      How clear-sighted I was to the nature of prejudice at this moment, and how
      many reflections passed in one instant, which I had never made before in
      the course of my life!&mdash;Meantime Mrs. Coates had beckoned to her son
      Peter, and Peter had drawn near, and was called upon by his mother to
      explain to my lord the cause of the <i>coolness</i> betwixt the alderman
      and Mr. Montenero: "It was," she said, "about the Manessas, and a young
      man called Jacob."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was not as fluent as his mother, and she went on. "It was some money
      matter. Mr. Montenero had begun by acting a very generous part, she
      understood, at first, by way of being the benevolent Jew, but had not come
      up to the alderman's expectations latterly, and had shown a most illiberal
      partiality to the Manessas, and this Jacob, only because they <i>was</i>
      Jews; which, you know," said Mrs. Coates, "was very ungentleman-like to
      the alderman, after all the civilities we had shown the Monteneros on
      their coming to Lon'on&mdash;as Peter, if he could open his mouth, could
      tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter had just opened his mouth, when Mr. Montenero appearing, he closed
      it again. To my inexpressible disappointment, Miss Montenero was not with
      her father. Mr. Montenero smiled the instant he caught my eye, but seeing
      my mother as he approached, he bowed gravely, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And never noticed me, I declare," said Mrs. Coates: "that's too good!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Miss Montenero! I thought she was to be here?" cried Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coates, after her fashion, stretching across two of her daughters,
      whispered to the third, loud enough for all to hear, "Queeney, this comes
      of airs!&mdash;This comes of her not choosing for to go abroad with me, I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If people doesn't know their friends when they has 'em," replied Queeney,
      "they may go farther and fare worse: that's all I have to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Peter, giving his sister a monitory pinch&mdash;"can't you
      say your say under your breath? <i>he's</i> within seven of you, and he
      has ears like the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All them Jews has, and Jewesses too; they think one's always talking of
      them, they're so suspicious," said Mrs. Coates. "I am told, moreover, that
      they've ways and means of hearing."
    </p>
    <p>
      To my great relief, she was interrupted by the auctioneer, and the sound
      of his hammer. The auction went on, and nothing but "Who bids more? going!&mdash;going!&mdash;who
      bids more?" was heard for a considerable time. Not being able to get near
      Mr. Montenero, and having failed in all my objects, I grew excessively
      tired, and was going away, leaving my mother to the care of Mowbray, but
      he stopped me. "Stay, stay," said he, drawing me aside, behind two
      connoisseurs, who were babbling about a Titian, "you will have some
      diversion by and by. I have a picture to sell, and you must see how it
      will go off. There is a painting that I bought at a stall for nothing,
      upon a speculation that my mother, who is a judge, will pay dear for; and
      what do you think the picture is? Don't look so stupid&mdash;it will
      interest you amazingly, and Mr. Montenero too, and 'tis a pity your Jewess
      is not here to see it. Did you ever hear of a picture called the
      'Dentition of the Jew?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll see, presently," said Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tell me <i>now</i>," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the drawing the teeth of the Jew, by order of some one of our most
      merciful lords the kings&mdash;John, Richard, or Edward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a companion to the old family picture of the Jew and Sir
      Josseline," continued Mowbray; "and this will make the vile daub, which
      I've had the luck to pick up, invaluable to my mother, and I trust very
      valuable to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! Christie has it up! The dear rascal! hear him puff it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady de Brantefield put up her glass, but neither she nor I could
      distinguish a single figure in the picture, the light so glared upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie caught her ladyship's eye, and addressed himself directly to her.
      But her ladyship was deaf. Mowbray pressed forward to her ear, and
      repeated all Christie roared. No sooner did she understand the subject of
      the picture than she turned to her son, to desire him to bid for her; but
      Mowbray substituted Topham in his stead: Topham obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who bids more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A bidder started up, who seemed very eager. He was, we were told, an
      engraver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who bids more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To our surprise, Mr. Montenero was the person to bid more&mdash;and more,
      and more, and more. The engraver soon gave up the contest, but her
      ladyship's pride and passions rose when she found Mr. Montenero continued
      to bid against her; and she persisted, till she came up to an extravagant
      sum; and still she desired Colonel Topham to bid on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond my expectation, faith! Both mad!" whispered Mowbray. I thought so
      too. Still Mr. Montenero went higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go no higher," said Lady de Brantefield; "you may let it be knocked
      down to that person, Colonel." Then turning to her son, "Who is the man
      that bids against me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Jewish gentleman, ma'am, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Jew, perhaps&mdash;gentleman, I deny; no Jew ever was or ever will be a
      gentleman. I am sure our family, since the time of Sir Josseline, have had
      reason enough to know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, ma'am&mdash;I'll call for your carriage, for I suppose you
      have had enough of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray carried me with him. "Come off," said he; "I long to hear
      Montenero descant on the merits of the dentition. Do you speak, for you
      can do it with a better face."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray seemed to be intent merely upon his own diversion; he must have
      seen and felt how reluctant I was: but, taking my arm, he dragged me on to
      Mr. Montenero, who was standing near a window, with the picture in his
      hand, examining it attentively. Mowbray pushed me on close behind Mr.
      Montenero&mdash;the light now falling on the picture, I saw it for the
      first time, and the sight struck me with such associated feelings of
      horror, that I started back, exclaiming, with vehement gestures, "I cannot
      bear it! I cannot bear that picture!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero turned, and looked at me with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon, sir," said I; "but it made me absolutely&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sick," said Mr. Montenero, opening the window, as I leaned back against
      the wall, and the eyes of all present were fixed upon me. Ashamed of the
      exaggerated expression of my feelings, I stood abashed. Mr. Montenero,
      with the greatest kindness of manner, and with friendly presence of mind,
      said he remembered well having felt actually sick at the sight of certain
      pictures. "For instance, my lord," said he, addressing himself to Lord
      Mowbray, "the famous picture of the flaying the unjust magistrate I never
      could look at steadily."
    </p>
    <p>
      I recovered myself&mdash;and squeezing Mr. Montenero's hand to express my
      sense of his kind politeness, I exerted myself to talk and to look at the
      picture. Afraid of Mowbray's ridicule, I never once turned my eyes towards
      him&mdash;I fancied that he was laughing behind me: I did him injustice;
      he was not laughing&mdash;he looked seriously concerned. He whispered to
      me, "Forgive me, my dear Harrington&mdash;I aimed at <i>mamma</i>&mdash;I
      did not mean to hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we quitted the subject, I expressed to Mr. Montenero my surprise at
      his having purchased, at an extraordinary price, a picture apparently of
      so little merit, and on such a disgusting subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abuse the subject as much as you please," interrupted Mowbray; "but as to
      the merit of the painting, have the grace, Harrington, to consider, that
      Mr. Montenero must be a better judge than you or I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too good a judge yourself, my lord," replied Mr. Montenero, in a
      reserved tone, "not to see this picture to be what it really is, a very
      poor performance." Then turning to me in a cordial manner, "Be assured,
      Mr. Harrington, that I am at least as clear-sighted, in every point of
      view, as you can possibly be, to its demerits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did you purchase it?" was the question, which involuntarily
      recurred to Mowbray and to me; but we were both silent, and stood with our
      eyes fixed upon the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, if you will do me the honour to dine with me to-morrow," said
      Mr. Montenero, "you shall know the purpose for which I bought this
      picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      We accepted the invitation; Mowbray waited for to-morrow with all the
      eagerness of curiosity, and I with the eagerness of a still more impatient
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass over my mother's remonstrances against my <i>dining at the
      Monteneros';</i> remonstrances, strengthened as they were in vehemence, if
      not in reason, by all the accession of force gathered from the
      representations and insinuations of Mrs. Coates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day came. "Now we shall hear about the dentition of the Jew,"
      said Mowbray, as we got to Mr. Montenero's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now we shall see Berenice! thought I.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found a very agreeable company assembled, mixed of English and
      foreigners. There was the Spanish ambassador and the Russian envoy&mdash;who,
      by-the-by, spoke English better than any foreigner I ever heard; a Polish
      Count, perfectly well bred, and his lady, a beautiful woman, with whom
      Mowbray of course was half in love before dinner was over. The only
      English present were General and Lady Emily B&mdash;&mdash;. We soon
      learned, by the course of the conversation, that Mr. Montenero stood high
      in the estimation of every individual in the company, all of whom had
      known him intimately at different times of his life, and in different
      countries. The general had served in America during the beginning of the
      war; he had been wounded there, and in great difficulties and distress. He
      and his lady, under very trying circumstances, had been treated in the
      most kind and hospitable manner by Mr. Montenero and his family. With that
      true English warmth of gratitude, which contrasts so strongly and
      agreeably with the natural reserve of English manner and habits, the
      general and his wife, Lady Emily, expressed their joy at having Mr.
      Montenero in England, in London, among their own friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, Mr. Montenero must let us introduce him to your brother and our
      other friends&mdash;how delighted they will be to see him! And Berenice!&mdash;she
      was such a little creature, General, at the time you saw her last!&mdash;but
      such a kind, sweet, little creature!&mdash;You remember her scraping the
      lint!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember it! certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of her, and looked at her, as if she was their own child; and
      for my part, I could have embraced both the old general and his wife. I
      only wished that my mother had been present to receive an antidote to Mrs.
      Coates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! please Heaven, we will make London&mdash;we'll make England agreeable
      to you&mdash;two years! no; that won't do&mdash;we will keep you with us
      for ever&mdash;you shall never go back to America."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a low voice, to Mr. Montenero, the general added, "Do you think
      we have not an Englishman good enough for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt the blood rush into my face, and dreaded that every eye must see
      it. When I had the courage to raise my head and to look round, I saw that
      I was perfectly safe, and that no creature was thinking about me, not even
      Mowbray, who was gallanting the Polish lady. I ventured then to look
      towards Berenice; but all was tranquil there&mdash;she had not, I was
      sure, heard the whisper. Mr. Montenero had his eye upon her; the father's
      eye and mine met&mdash;and such a penetrating, yet such a benevolent eye!
      I endeavoured to listen with composure to whatever was going on. The
      general was talking of his brother-in-law, Lord Charles; a panic seized
      me, and a mortal curiosity to know what sort of a man the brother-in-law
      might be. I was not relieved till the dessert came on the table, when,
      apropos to something a Swedish gentleman said about Linnaeus,
      strawberries, and the gout, it appeared, to my unspeakable satisfaction,
      that Lord Charles had the gout at this instant, and had been subject to it
      during the last nine years. I had been so completely engrossed by my own
      feelings and imaginations, that I had never once thought of that which had
      previously excited our curiosity&mdash;the picture, till, as we were going
      into another room to drink coffee, Mowbray said to me, "We hear nothing of
      the dentition of the Jew: I can't put him in mind of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said I. "There is a harp; I hope Miss Montenero will play
      on it," added I.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coffee we had some good music, in different styles, so as to please,
      and interest, and join in one common sympathy, all the company, many of
      whom had never before heard each other's national music. Berenice was
      asked to play some Hebrew music, the good general reminding her that he
      knew she had a charming ear and a charming voice when she was a child. She
      had not, however, been used to sing or play before numbers, and she
      resisted the complimentary entreaties; but when the company were all gone,
      except the general and his lady, Mowbray and myself, her father requested
      that Berenice would try one song, and that she would play one air on the
      harp to oblige her old friends: she immediately complied, with a graceful
      unaffected modesty that interested every heart in her favour&mdash;I can
      answer for my own; though no connoisseur, I was enthusiastically fond of
      good music. Miss Montenero's voice was exquisite: both the poetry and the
      music were sublime and touching. No compliments were paid; but when she
      ceased, all were silent, in hopes that the harp would be touched again by
      the same hand. At this moment, Mr. Montenero, turning to Lord Mowbray and
      to me, said, "Gentlemen, I recollect my promise to you, and will perform
      it&mdash;I will now explain why I bought that painting which you saw me
      yesterday so anxious to obtain."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell, and desired a servant to bring in the picture which he
      had purchased at the auction, and to desire Jacob to come with it. As soon
      as it was brought in, I retired to the farther end of the room. In
      Mowbray's countenance there was a strange mixture of contempt and
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero kindly said to me, "I shall not insist, Mr. Harrington, on
      your looking at it; I know it is not to your taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      I immediately approached, resolved to stand the sight, that I might not be
      suspected of affectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice had not yet seen the painting: she shrunk back the moment she
      beheld it, exclaiming, "Oh, father! Why purchase such a horrible picture?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To destroy it," said Mr. Montenero. And deliberately he took the picture
      out of its frame and cut it to pieces, repeating, "To destroy it, my dear,
      as I would, were it in my power, every record of cruelty and intolerance.
      So perish all that can keep alive feelings of hatred and vengeance between
      Jews and Christians!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen," said the good old general, and all present joined in that <i>amen</i>.
      I heard it pronounced by Miss Montenero in a very low voice, but
      distinctly and fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood with my eyes fixed on Berenice, and while Mowbray loudly
      applauded her father's liberality, Mr. Montenero turned to Jacob and said,
      "I sent for my friend Jacob to be present at the burning of this picture,
      because it was he who put it in my power to prevent this horrid
      representation from being seen and sold in every print-shop in London.
      Jacob, who goes every where, and <i>sees</i> wherever he goes, observed
      this picture at a broker's shop, and found that two persons had been in
      treaty for it. One of them had the appearance of an amateur, the other was
      an artist, an engraver. The engraver was, I suppose, the person who bid
      against Colonel Topham and me; who the other gentleman was, and why he
      bought in to sell it again at that auction, perhaps Jacob knows, but I
      have never inquired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with Jacob's assistance, Mr. Montenero burned every shred of this
      abominable picture, to my inexpressible satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this <i>auto-da-f</i>, Jacob cast a glance at Mowbray, the meaning
      of which I could not at first comprehend; but I supposed that he was
      thinking of the fire, at which all he had in the world had been consumed
      at Gibraltar. I saw, or thought I saw, that Jacob checked the feeling this
      recollection excited. He turned to me, and in a low voice told me, that
      Mr. Montenero had been so kind as to obtain for him a lucrative and
      creditable situation in the house of Manessa, the jeweller; and the next
      day he was to go to Mr. Manessa's, and to commence business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Mr. Harrington, you see that after all my misfortunes, I am now
      established in a manner far above what could have been expected for poor
      Jacob&mdash;far above his most sanguine hopes. Thanks to my good friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to your good self," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much pleased with Mowbray at this instant, for the manner in which
      he joined in my praise of Jacob, and in congratulations to him. His
      lordship promised that he would recommend his house to all his family and
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a contrast," said Mowbray, as soon as Jacob had left the room,
      "there is between Jacob and his old rival, Dutton! That fellow has turned
      out very ill&mdash;drunken, idle dog&mdash;is reduced to an old-iron shop,
      I believe&mdash;always plaguing me with begging letters. Certainly,
      Harrington, you may triumph in your election of Jacob."
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw Berenice and her father look so much pleased with Mowbray as
      they did at this instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the remainder of the evening I recollect nothing but Berenice, and of
      my staying later than I ought to have done. Even after the general and his
      wife had departed some time, I lingered. I was to go home in Mowbray's
      carriage, and twice he had touched my shoulder, telling me that I was not
      aware how late it was. I could not conceive how he could think of going so
      early.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Early!" He directed my eye to the clock on the chimneypiece. I was
      ashamed to see the hour. I apologized to Mr. Montenero. He replied in a
      manner that was more than polite&mdash;that was quite affectionate; and
      his last words, repeated at the head of the stairs, expressed a desire to
      see me again <i>frequently</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang into Mowbray's carriage one of the happiest men on earth, full of
      love, hope, and joy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "All gone to bed but you?" said I to the footman, who opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said the drowsy fellow, "my lady is sitting up for you, I
      believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Mowbray, come in&mdash;come up with me to my mother, pray do, for
      one instant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she slept, I said, he must administer an antidote to Coates's
      poison. While the impression was still fresh in his mind, I entreated he
      would say what a delightful party we had had. My mother, I knew, had such
      a high idea of his lordship's judgment in all that concerned gentility and
      fashion, that a word from him would be decisive. "But let it be to-morrow
      morning," said Mowbray; "'tis shamefully late to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-night&mdash;to-night&mdash;now, now," persisted I. He complied: "Any
      thing to oblige you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember," said I, as we ran up stairs, "Spanish ambassador, Russian
      envoy, Polish Count and Countess, and an English general and his lady&mdash;strong
      in rank we'll burst upon the enemy." I flung open the door, but my spirits
      were suddenly checked; I saw it was no time for jest and merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead silence&mdash;solemn stillness&mdash;candles with unsnuffed wicks of
      portentous length. My father and mother were sitting with their backs half
      turned to each other, my mother leaning her head on her hand, with her
      elbow on the table, her salts before her. My father sitting in his
      arm-chair, legs stretched out, feet upon the bars of the grate, back
      towards us&mdash;but that back spoke anger as plainly as a back could
      speak. Neither figure moved when we entered. I stood appalled; Mowbray
      went forward, though I caught his arm to pull him back. But he did not
      understand me, and with ill-timed gaiety and fluency, that I would have
      given the world to stop, he poured forth to my mother in praise of all we
      had seen and heard; and then turning to my father, who slowly rose,
      shading his eyes from the candle, and looking at me under the hand, Lord
      Mowbray went on with a rapturous eulogium upon Harrington's Jew and
      Jewess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it is all true," said my father. "It is all very well, Harrington&mdash;but
      take notice, and I give you notice in time, in form, before your friend
      and counsellor, Lord Mowbray, that by Jupiter&mdash;by Jupiter Ammon, I
      will never leave one shilling to my son, if he marry a Jewess! Every inch
      of my estate shall go from him to his cousin Longshanks in the North,
      though I hate him like sin. But a Jewess for my daughter-in-law I will
      never have&mdash;by Jupiter Ammon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So snatching up a bougie, the wick of which scattered fire behind him, he
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! what have I done?" cried Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you can never undo," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother spoke not one word, but sat smelling her salts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never fear, man," whispered Mowbray; "he will sleep it off, or by
      to-morrow we shall find ways and means."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me in despair. I heard his carriage roll away&mdash;and then there
      was silence again. I stood waiting for some explanation from my mother&mdash;she
      saw my despair&mdash;she dreaded my anger: in broken and scarcely
      intelligible, contradictory phrases, she declared her innocence of all
      intention to do me mischief, and acknowledged that all was her doing; but
      reminded me, that she had prophesied it would come to this&mdash;it would
      end ill&mdash;and at last, trembling with impatience as I stood, she told
      me all that had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, that she had talked to her friend Lady de Brantefield, and
      some other of her dear friends, of her dread that I should fall in love
      with Miss Montenero; and the next person said I had fallen in love with
      her; and under the seal of secresy,&mdash;it was told that I had actually
      proposed for her, but that my father was to know nothing of the matter.
      This story had been written in some young lady's letter to her
      correspondent in the country, and miss in the country had told it to her
      brother, who had come to town this day, dined in company with my father,
      got drunk, and had given a bumper toast to "Miss Montenero, the Jewish
      heiress&mdash;<i>Mrs. Harrington, jun. that is to be!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      My father had come home foaming with rage; my mother had done all she
      could to appease him, and to make him comprehend that above half what he
      had heard was false; but it had gone the wrong way into his head, and
      there was no getting it out again. My father had heard it at the most
      unlucky time possible, just after he had lost a good place, and was driven
      to the necessity of selling an estate that had been in his family since
      the time of Richard the Second. My mother farther informed me, that my
      father had given orders, in his usual sudden way when angry, for going
      into the country immediately. While she was yet speaking, the door opened,
      and my father, with his nightcap on, put his head in, saying, "Remember,
      ma'am, you are to be off at seven to-morrow&mdash;and you sir," continued
      he, advancing towards me, "if you have one grain of sense left, I
      recommend it to you to come with us. But no, I see it written in your
      absurd face, that you will not&mdash;obstinate madman! I leave you to your
      own discretion," cried he, turning his back upon me; "but, by Jupiter
      Ammon, I'll do what I say, by Jupiter!" And carrying my mother off with
      him, he left me to my pleasing reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was tumult in my mind: one moment I stood motionless in utter despair,
      the next struck with some bright hope. I walked up and down the room with
      hasty strides&mdash;then stopped short again, and stood fixed, as some
      dark reality, some sense of improbability&mdash;of impossibility, crossed
      my mind, and as my father's denunciation recurred to my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Jewess!&mdash;her religion&mdash;her principles&mdash;my principles!&mdash;And
      can a Jewess marry a Christian? And should a Christian marry a Jewess? The
      horrors of family quarrels, of religious dissensions and disputes between
      father and child, husband and wife&mdash;All these questions, and fears,
      and doubts, passed through my imagination backwards and forwards with
      inconceivable rapidity&mdash;struck me with all the amazement of novelty,
      though in fact they were not new to me. The first moment I saw her, I was
      told she was a Jewess; I was aware of the difficulties, and yet I had
      never fixed my view upon them: I had suffered myself to waive the
      consideration of them till this moment. In the hope, the joy, the heaven
      of the first feelings of the passion of love, I had lost sight of all
      difficulties, human or divine; and now I was called upon to decide in one
      hour upon questions involving the happiness of my whole life. To be called
      upon before it was necessary too&mdash;for I was not in love, not I&mdash;at
      least I had formed no idea of marrying, no resolution to propose. Then
      bitterly I execrated the reporters, and the gossipers, and the
      letter-writing misses, whose tattling, and meddling, and idleness, and
      exaggeration, and absolute falsehood, had precipitated me into this
      misery. The drunken brute, too, who had blundered out to my father that
      fatal toast, had his full share of my indignation; and my mother, with her
      <i>presentiments</i>&mdash;and Mowbray, with his inconceivable imprudence&mdash;and
      my father, with his prejudices, his violence, and his Jupiter Ammon&mdash;every
      body, and every thing I blamed, except myself. And when I had vented my
      rage, still the question recurred, what was to be done? how should I
      resolve? Morning was come, the grey light was peeping through the
      shutters: I opened the window to feel the fresh calm air. I heard the
      people beginning to stir in the house: my father and mother were to be
      called at half after six. Six struck; I must decide at least, whether I
      would go with them or not. No chance of my father sleeping it off!
      Obstinate beyond conception; and by Jupiter Ammon once sworn, never
      revoked. But after all, where was the great evil of being disinherited?
      The loss of my paternal estate, in this moment of enthusiasm, appeared a
      loss I could easily endure. Berenice was an heiress&mdash;a rich heiress,
      and I had a small estate of my own, left to me by my grandfather. I could
      live with Berenice upon any thing&mdash;upon nothing. Her wishes were
      moderate, I was sure&mdash;I should not, however, reduce her to poverty;
      no, her fortune would be sufficient for us both. It would be mortifying to
      my pride&mdash;it would be painful to receive instead of to give&mdash;I
      had resolved never to be under such an obligation to a wife; but with such
      a woman as Berenice!&mdash;I would submit&mdash;submit to accept her and
      her fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as to her being a Jewess&mdash;who knows what changes love might
      produce? Voltaire and Mowbray say, "qu'une femme est toujours de la
      religion de son amant."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant I heard a heavy foot coming down the back stairs; the door
      opened, and a yawning housemaid appeared, and started at the sight of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious! I didn't think it was so late! Mistress bid me ask the first
      thing I did&mdash;but I didn't know it was so late&mdash;Mercy! there's
      master's bell&mdash;whether you go or not, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said I; and after having uttered this determination, I
      was more at ease. I sat down, and wrote a note to my father, in the most
      respectful and eloquent terms I could devise, judging that it was better
      to write than to speak to him on the subject. Then I vacated the room for
      the housemaid, and watched in my own apartment till all the noises of
      preparation and of departure were over; and till I heard the sound of the
      carriage driving away. I was surprised that my mother had not come to me
      to endeavour to persuade me to change my determination; but my father, I
      heard, had hurried her into the carriage&mdash;my note I found on the
      table torn down the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I concluded that my cousin Longshanks was in a fair way to have the
      estate; but I went to bed and to sleep, and I was consoled with dreams of
      Berenice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray was with me in the morning before I was dressed. I had felt so
      angry with him, that I had resolved a hundred times during the night that
      I would never more admit him into my confidence&mdash;however, he
      contrived to prevent my reproaches, and dispel my anger, by the great
      concern he expressed for his precipitation. He blamed himself so much,
      that, instead of accusing, I began to comfort him. I assured him that he
      had, in fact, done me a service instead of an injury, by bringing my
      affairs suddenly to a crisis: I had thus been forced to come at once to a
      decision. "What decision?" he eagerly asked. My heart was at this instant
      in such immediate want of sympathy, that it opened to him. I told him all
      that had passed between my father and me, told him my father's vow, and my
      resolution to continue, at all hazards, my pursuit of Berenice. He heard
      me with astonishment: he said he could not tell which was most rash, my
      father's vow, or my resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your father is gone, actually gone," cried Mowbray; "and, in spite of
      his Jupiter Ammon, you stand resolved to brave your fate, and to pursue
      the fair Jewess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even so," said I: "this day I will know my fate&mdash;this day I will
      propose for Miss Montenero."
    </p>
    <p>
      Against this mad precipitation he argued in the most earnest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were the first duke in England, Harrington," said he, "with the
      finest estate, undipped, unencumbered, unentailed; if, consequently, you
      had nothing to do but to ask and have any woman for a wife; still I should
      advise you, if you meant to secure the lady's heart as well as her hand,
      not to begin in this novice-like manner, by letting her see her power over
      you: neither woman nor man ever valued an easy conquest. No, trust me,
      keep your mind to yourself till the lady is dying to know it&mdash;keep
      your own counsel till the lady can no longer keep hers: when you are sure
      of her not being able to refuse you, then ask for her heart as humbly as
      you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the whole of this doctrine I could not, in honour, generosity, or
      delicacy accede. Of the wisdom of avoiding the danger of a refusal I was
      perfectly sensible; but, in declaring my attachment to Miss Montenero, I
      meant only to ask permission to address her. To win her heart I was well
      aware must be a work of time; but the first step was to deserve her
      esteem, and to begin by conducting myself towards her, and her father,
      with perfect sincerity and openness. The more I was convinced of my
      father's inflexibility, the more desperate I knew my circumstances were,
      the more I was bound not to mislead by false appearances. They would
      naturally suppose that I should inherit my father's fortune&mdash;I knew
      that I should not, if&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then," interrupted Mowbray, "with your perfect openness and
      sincerity, you will go to Mr. Montenero, and you will say, 'Sir, that you
      are a Jew, I know; that you are as rich as a Jew, I hope; that you are a
      fool, I take for granted: at all events, I am a madman and a beggar, or
      about to be a beggar. My father, who is a good and a most obstinate
      Christian, swore last night by Jupiter Ammon, the only oath which he never
      breaks, that he will disinherit me if I marry a Jewess: therefore, I come
      this morning to ask you, sir, for your daughter, who is a Jewess, and as I
      am told, a great heiress&mdash;which last circumstance is, in my opinion,
      a great objection, but I shall overcome it in favour of your daughter, if
      you will be pleased to give her to me. Stay, sir, I beg your pardon, sir,
      excuse the hurry of the passions, which, probably, you have long since
      forgotten; the fact is, I do not mean to ask you for your daughter,&mdash;I
      came simply to ask your permission to fall in love with her, which I have
      already done without your permission; and I trust she has, on her part,
      done likewise; for if I had not a shrewd suspicion that your Jessica was
      ready, according to the custom of Jews' daughters, to jump out of a
      two-pair of stairs window into her lover's arms, madman as I am, I could
      not be such an idiot as to present myself before you, as I now do, sir,
      suing <i>in forma pauperis</i> for the pleasure of becoming your
      son-in-law. I must further have the honour to tell you, and with perfect
      sincerity and consideration let me inform you, sir, that my Christian
      father and mother having resolved never to admit a Jewish daughter-in-law
      to the honours of the maternal or paternal embrace, when your daughter
      shall do me the favour to become my wife, she need not quit your house or
      family, as she cannot be received into mine. Here, sir, I will rest my
      cause; but I might farther plead&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plead no more for or against me, Mowbray," interrupted I, angrily turning
      from him, for I could bear it no longer. Enthusiasm detests wit much, and
      humour more. Enthusiasm, fancying itself raised above the reach of
      ridicule, is always incensed when it feels that it is not safe from its
      shafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray changed his tone, and checking his laughter, said seriously, and
      with an air of affectionate sympathy, that, at the hazard of displeasing
      me, he had used the only means he had conceived to be effectual to prevent
      me from taking a step which he was convinced would be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him for his advice, but I had previously been too much piqued by
      his raillery to allow his reasons even their due weight: besides, I began
      to have a secret doubt of the sincerity of his friendship. In his turn, he
      was provoked by my inflexible adherence to my own opinion; and perhaps,
      suspecting my suspicion, he was the more readily displeased. He spoke with
      confidence, I thought with arrogance, as a man notoriously successful in
      the annals of gallantry, treating me, as I could not bear to be treated,
      like a novice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I flatter myself, no man is less a coxcomb with regard to women than I
      am," Lord Mowbray modestly began; "but if I were inclined to boast, I
      believe it is pretty generally allowed in town, by all who know any thing
      of these things, that my practice in gallantry has been somewhat
      successful&mdash;perhaps undeservedly so; still, in these cases, the world
      judges by success: I may, therefore, be permitted to think that I know
      something of women. My advice consequently, I thought, might be of use;
      but, after all, perhaps I am wrong: often those who imagine that they know
      women best, know them least."
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I did not presume to vie with Lord Mowbray as a man of
      gallantry; but I should conceive that the same precepts, and the same
      arts, which ensured success with women of a <i>certain class</i>, might
      utterly fail with women of different habits and tastes. If the question
      were how to win such and such an actress (naming one who had sacrificed
      her reputation for Mowbray, and another, for whom he was sacrificing his
      fortune), I should, I said, implicitly follow his advice; but that, novice
      as I was in gallantry, I should venture to follow my own judgment as to
      the mode of pleasing such a woman as Miss Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None but a novice," Mowbray answered, laughing, "could think that there
      was any essential difference between woman and woman." Every woman was at
      heart the same. Of this he was so much convinced, that though he had not,
      he said, any absurd confidence in his own peculiar powers of pleasing, he
      was persuaded, that if honour had not put the trial quite out of the
      question on his part, he could as easily have won the fair Jewess as any
      other of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      My indignation rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honour and friendship to me, my lord, are out of the question: forgive
      me, if I own that I do not think your lordship would there have any chance
      of success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events you know you are safe; I cannot make the trial without your
      permission." "Your lordship is perfectly at liberty, if you think proper,
      to make the trial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!&mdash;Are you in earnest?&mdash;Now you have put it into my head,
      I will think of it seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a careless, pick-tooth manner, he stood, as if for some moments
      debating the matter with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no great taste for matrimony or for Jewesses, but a Jewish heiress
      in the present state of my affairs&mdash;Harrington, you know the pretty
      little gipsy&mdash;the actress who played Jessica that night, so famous in
      your imagination, so fatal to us both&mdash;well, my little Jessica has,
      since that time, played away at a rare rate with my ready money&mdash;<i>dipped
      me</i> confoundedly&mdash;'twould be poetic justice to make one Jewess pay
      for another, if one could. Two hundred thousand pounds, Miss Montenero is,
      I think they say. 'Pon my sincerity, 'tis a temptation! Now it strikes me&mdash;if
      I am not bound in honour&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked away in disgust, while Mowbray, in the same tone, continued, "Let
      me see, now&mdash;suppose&mdash;only suppose&mdash;any thing may be by
      supposition&mdash;suppose we were rivals. As rivals, things would be
      wonderfully fair and even between us. You, Harrington, I grant, have the
      advantage of first impressions&mdash;she has smiled upon you; while I,
      bound in honour, stood by like a mummy&mdash;but unbound, set at liberty
      by express permission&mdash;give me a fortnight's time, and if I don't
      make her blush, my name's not Mowbray!&mdash;and no matter whom a woman
      smiles upon, the man who makes her blush is the man. But seriously,
      Harrington, am I hurting your feelings? If what is play to me is death to
      you, I have done. Bind me over again to my good behaviour you may, by a
      single word. Instead of defying me, only swear, or, stay&mdash;I won't put
      you to your oath&mdash;say candidly, upon your honour, Lord Mowbray puts
      you in fear of your love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I neither defy you nor fear you, my lord!" said I, with a tone and look
      which at any other time Lord Mowbray, who was prompt enough to take
      offence, would have understood as it was meant. But he was now determined
      not to be provoked by any thing I could say or look. Standing still at
      ease, he continued, "Not fear me!&mdash;Not bind me in honour!&mdash;Then
      I have nobody's feelings to consult but my own. So, as I was considering,
      things are marvellously nicely balanced between us. In point of fortune,
      both beggars&mdash;nearly; for though my father did not disinherit me, I
      have disinherited myself. Then our precious mothers will go mad on the
      spot, in white satin, if either of us marry a Jewess. Well! that is even
      between us. Then religious scruples&mdash;you have some, have not you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry enough&mdash;there I have the advantage&mdash;I have none. Mosque&mdash;high
      church&mdash;low church&mdash;no church&mdash;don't let me shock you. I
      thought you were for universal toleration; I am for liberty of conscience,
      in marriage at least. You are very liberal, I know. You're in love, and
      you'd marry even a Jewess, would not you, if you could not contrive to
      convert her? I am not in love, but shall be soon, I feel; and when once I
      am in love!&mdash;I turn idolater, plump. Now, an idolater's worse than a
      Jew: so I should make it a point of conscience to turn Jew, to please the
      fair Jewess, if requisite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, this trifling I can bear no longer; I must beg seriously that we
      may understand each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trifling!&mdash;Never was more serious in my life. I'd turn Jew&mdash;I'd
      turn any thing, for a woman I loved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, or have you not, my lord, any intention of addressing Miss
      Montenero?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I have your permission&mdash;since you have put it in my head&mdash;since
      you have piqued me&mdash;frankly&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for your frankness, my lord; I understand you. Now we
      understand each other," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes&mdash;and 'tis time we should," said Mowbray, coolly, "knowing
      one another, as we have done, even from our boyish days. You may remember,
      I never could bear to be piqued, <i>en honneur;</i> especially by you, my
      dear Harrington. It was written above, that we were to be rivals. But
      still, if we could command our tempers&mdash;I was the hottest of the two,
      when we were boys; but seeing something of the world, abroad and at home,
      has done wonders for me. If you could coolly pursue this business as I
      wish, in the comic rather than the heroic style, we might still, though
      rivals, be friends&mdash;very good friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord, no: here all friendship between us ends." "Be it so," said
      Lord Mowbray: "then sworn foes instead of sworn friends&mdash;and open war
      is the word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open war!&mdash;yes&mdash;better than hollow peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then a truce for to-day; to-morrow, with your good leave, I enter the
      lists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you please, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fearful odds, I own. The first flourish of trumpets, by that trumpeter of
      yours, Jacob, has been in favour of the champion of the Jew pedlars; and
      the lady with bright Jewish eyes has bowed to her knight, and he has
      walked the field triumphantly alone; but Mowbray&mdash;Lord Mowbray
      appears! Farewell, Harrington!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, laughing, and left me. 'Twas well he did; I could not have borne
      it another second, and I could not insult the man in my own house&mdash;anger,
      disdainful anger, possessed me. My heart had, in the course of a few
      hours, been successively a prey to many violent conflicting passions; and
      at the moment when I most wanted the support, the sympathy of a friend, I
      found myself duped, deserted, ridiculed! I felt alone in the world, and
      completely miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A truce for this day was agreed upon. I had a few hours' time for
      reflection&mdash;much wanted. During this interval, which appeared to me a
      most painful suspense, I had leisure to reconsider my difficulties. Now
      that I was left to my own will entirely, should I decide to make an
      immediate declaration? As I revolved this question in my thoughts, my mind
      altered with every changing view which the hopes and fears of a lover
      threw upon the subject. I was not perfectly well informed as to the
      material point, whether the Jewish religion and Jewish customs permitted
      intermarriages with Christians. Mowbray's levity had suggested alarming
      doubts: perhaps he had purposely thrown them out; be that as it would, I
      must be satisfied. I made general inquiries as to the Jewish customs from
      Jacob, and he, careful to answer with propriety, kept also to general
      terms, lest he should appear to understand my particular views: he could
      tell me only, that in some cases, more frequently on the continent and in
      America than in England, Jews have married Christian women, and the wives
      have continued undisturbed in their faith; whether such marriages were
      regularly permitted or not, Jacob could not say&mdash;no precedent that he
      could recollect was exactly a case in point. This difficulty concerning
      religion increased, instead of diminishing, in magnitude and importance,
      the more my imagination dwelt upon it&mdash;the longer it was considered
      by my reason: I must take more time before I could determine. Besides, I
      was <i>curious</i>&mdash;I would not allow that I was <i>anxious</i>&mdash;to
      see how Miss Montenero would conduct herself towards Lord Mowbray&mdash;a
      man of rank&mdash;a man of fashion&mdash;supposed to be a man of fortune&mdash;known
      to be a man of wit and gallantry: I should have an opportunity, such as I
      had never before had, of seeing her tried; and I should be able to
      determine whether I had really obtained any interest in her heart. On this
      last point particularly, I could now, without hazard of a mortifying
      refusal, or of a precipitate engagement, decide. Add to these distinct
      reasons, many mixed motives, which acted upon me without my defining or
      allowing them in words. I had spoken and thought with contempt of Lord
      Mowbray's chance of success; but in spite of my pride in my own
      superiority of principle and character, in spite of my confidence in
      Berenice and in myself, I had my secret, very secret, quailings of the
      heart. I thought, when it came to the point, that it would be best to wait
      a little longer, before I hazarded that declaration which must bring her
      to direct acceptance or rejection; in short, I determined not to throw
      myself at her feet precipitately. I took Mowbray's advice after all; but I
      took it when I had made it my own opinion: and still I rejoiced that my
      resistance to the arrogant manner in which Lord Mowbray had laid down the
      law of gallantry, had produced that struggle of the passions, in the
      height of which his mask had fallen off. I never could decide whether the
      thought of becoming my rival really struck him, as he said it did, from
      the pique of the moment; or whether he only seized the occasion to declare
      a design he had previously formed: no matter&mdash;we were now declared
      rivals.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After our declaration of hostilities, Lord Mowbray and I first met on
      neutral ground at the Opera&mdash;Miss Montenero was there. We were both
      eager to mark our pretensions to her publicly. I appeared this night to
      great disadvantage: I certainly did not conduct myself prudently&mdash;I
      lost the command of my temper. Lord Mowbray met me with the same
      self-possession, the same gay, careless manner which had provoked me so
      much during our last interview. To the by-standers, who knew nothing of
      what had passed between us, his lordship must have appeared the pink of
      courtesy, the perfection of gentlemanlike ease and good-humour; whilst I,
      unable to suppress symptoms of indignation, of contempt, and perhaps of
      jealousy, appeared, in striking contrast, captious, haughty, and at best
      incomprehensible. Mr. Montenero looked at me with much surprise, and some
      concern. In Miss Montenero's countenance I thought I saw more concern than
      surprise; she was alarmed&mdash;she grew pale, and I repented of some
      haughty answer I had made to Lord Mowbray, in maintaining a place next to
      her, which he politely ceded to my impetuosity: he seated himself on the
      other side of her, in a place which, if I had not been blinded by passion,
      I might have seen and taken as quietly as he did. I was more and more
      vexed by perceiving that Mr. Montenero appeared to be, with all his
      penetration, duped this night by Mowbray's show of kindness towards me; he
      whispered once or twice to Mr. Montenero, and they seemed as if they were
      acting in concert, both observing that I was out of temper, and Lord
      Mowbray showing Mr. Montenero how he bore with me. In fact, I desired
      nothing so much as an opportunity of quarrelling with him, and he, though
      determined to put me ostensibly and flagrantly in the wrong, desired
      nothing better than to commence his operation by the eclat of a duel. If
      Miss Montenero had understood her business as a heroine, a duel, as every
      body expected, must have taken place between us, in consequence of the
      happy dispositions in which we both were this night: nothing but the
      presence of mind and unexpected determination of Miss Montenero could have
      prevented it. I sat regretting that I had given a moment's pain or alarm
      to her timid sensibility, while I observed the paleness of her cheek, and
      a tremor in her under lip, which betrayed how much she had been agitated.
      Some talking lady of the party began to give an account, soon afterwards,
      of a duel in high life, which was then the conversation of the day: Lord
      Mowbray and I were both attentive, and so was Miss Montenero. When she
      observed that our attention was fixed, and when there was a pause in the
      conversation in which her low voice could be distinctly heard, she,
      conquering her extreme timidity, and with a calmness that astonished us
      all, said, that she did not pretend to be a judge of what gentlemen might
      think right or wrong about duels, but that for her own part she had formed
      a resolution&mdash;an unalterable resolution, never to marry a man who had
      fought a duel in which he had been the challenger. Her father, who was
      behind her, leaned forward, and asked what his daughter said&mdash;she
      deliberately repeated her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      That instant I recovered perfect command of temper&mdash;I resolved that
      at all events I never would be the person to give the challenge, and Lord
      Mowbray, at the same instant, I believe, resolved that I should, if he
      could so manage it without appearing to be the aggressor. We were both of
      us firmly convinced that Miss Montenero was in earnest; the manner in
      which she spoke, and the strong evidence of her power over herself at this
      moment, impressed us completely with this conviction. A young lady, a
      stranger in London, averse from appearing, infinitely more averse from
      speaking before numbers, who, when all eyes, and some of them no friendly
      eyes, were fixed upon her, could so far conquer her excessive
      susceptibility to the opinion of others, as to pronounce, in such
      circumstances, such a new and extraordinary determination, was certainly
      to be deemed capable of abiding by her resolution. She was much blamed, I
      heard afterwards, for the resolution, and more for the declaration. It was
      said to be "quite unfit for a lady, and particularly for so young a lady.
      Till swords were actually drawn, she should never have thought of such a
      thing: then, to presume that she or her fortune were of such consequence,
      that her declaration could influence gentlemen&mdash;could have any effect
      on Lord Mowbray! He did her a vast deal too much honour in paying her any
      of those attentions which every body knew meant nothing&mdash;a Jewess,
      too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Montenero never afterwards spoke on the subject; the effect she
      desired was produced, and no other power, I am persuaded, could have been
      sufficient to have made me preserve command of myself, during my daily,
      hourly trials of temper, in those contentions for her favour which ensued.
      Lord Mowbray, by every secret art that could pique my pride, my jealousy,
      or my love, endeavoured to provoke me to challenge him. At first this
      struggle in my mind was violent&mdash;I had reason to fear my rival's
      address, and practised powers of pleasing. He used his utmost skill, and
      that skill was great. He began by exerting all his wit, humour, and
      vivacity, to entertain in conversation; while I, with a spell over my
      faculties, could not produce to advantage any one thing I knew or had ever
      known. What became of my ideas I know not, but I was sensible of my being
      very stupid and disagreeable. Aware of the contrast, aware that Miss
      Montenero saw and felt it, I grew ten times worse, more silent, and more
      stupid. Mowbray, happy and confident, went on, secure of victory. He was
      an excellent actor, and he was now to act falling in love, which he did by
      such fine degrees, and with a nicety of art which so exquisitely imitated
      nature, that none but the most suspicious or the most practised could have
      detected the counterfeit. From being the most entertaining, lively man in
      London, Lord Mowbray became serious, grave, and sentimental. From being a
      gallant, gay Lothario, he was reformed, likely to make the best husband in
      the world, provided he marry the woman he loves, and who has influence
      over him sufficient to make his reformation last for life. This Lord
      Mowbray, in every possible form of insinuation, gave Miss Montenero to
      understand was precisely her case and his; she had first, he said, given
      him a taste for refined female society, disgusted him with his former
      associates, especially with the women of whom he could not now bear to
      think; he had quarrelled with&mdash;parted with all his mistresses&mdash;his
      Jessica, the best beloved&mdash;parted from irrevocably. This was dropped
      with propriety in conversation with Mr. Montenero. The influence of a
      virtuous attachment is well known. The effects on Lord Mowbray were, as he
      protested, wonderful; he scarcely knew himself&mdash;indeed I scarcely
      knew him, though I had been, as it were, behind the scenes, and had seen
      him preparing for his character. Though he knew that I knew that he was
      acting, yet this never disconcerted him in the slightest degree&mdash;never
      gave him one twinge of conscience, or hesitation from shame, in my
      presence. Whenever I attempted openly&mdash;I was too honourable, and he
      knew I was too honourable, to betray his confidence, or to undermine him
      secretly&mdash;whenever I attempted openly to expose him, he foiled me&mdash;his
      cunning was triumphant, and the utmost I could accomplish was, in the acme
      of my indignation, to keep my temper, and recollect Miss Montenero's
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she seemed not at first in the least to suspect Lord Mowbray's
      sincerity, she was, as I rejoiced to perceive, little interested by his
      professions: she was glad he was reformed, for his sake; but for her own
      part, her vanity was not flattered. There seemed to be little chance on
      this plea of persuading her to take charge of him for life. My heart beat
      again with hope&mdash;how I admired her!&mdash;and I almost forgave Lord
      Mowbray. My indignation against him, I must own, was not always as
      steadily proportioned to his deserts as for the sake of my pride and
      consistency I could wish to represent it. In recording this part of the
      history of my life, truth obliges me to acknowledge that my anger rose or
      fell in proportion to the degree of fear I felt of the possibility of his
      success; whenever my hope and my confidence in myself increased, I found
      it wonderfully easy to command my temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my rival was a man of infinite resource; when one mode of attack
      failed, he tried another. Vanity, in some form, he was from experience
      convinced must be the ruling passion of the female heart&mdash;and vanity
      is so accessible, so easily managed. Miss Montenero was a stranger, a
      Jewess, just entering into the fashionable world&mdash;just doubting, as
      he understood, whether she should make London her future residence, or
      return to her retirement in the wilds of America. Lord Mowbray wished to
      make her sensible that his public attentions would bring her at once into
      fashion; and though his mother, the prejudiced Lady De Brantefield, could
      not be prevailed upon to visit a Jewess, yet his lordship had a vast
      number of high connexions and relations, to all of whom he could introduce
      Mr. and Miss Montenero. Lady Anne Mowbray, indeed, unaccountably persisted
      in saying every where, that she was certain her brother had no more
      thought of the Jewess than of the queen of the gipsies. Whenever she saw
      Miss Montenero in public, her ladyship had, among her own set, a
      never-failing source of sarcasm and ridicule in the Spanish fashion of
      Miss Montenero's dress, especially her long veils&mdash;veils were not
      then in fashion, and Lady Anne of course pronounced them to be hideous. It
      was at this time, in England, the reign of high heads: a sort of
      triangular cushion or edifice of horsehair, suppose nine inches diagonal,
      three inches thick, by seven in height, called I believe a <i>toque</i> or
      a <i>system</i>, was fastened on the female head, I do not well know how,
      with black pins a quarter of a yard long; and upon and over this <i>system</i>,
      the hair was erected, and crisped, and frizzed, and thickened with soft
      pomatum, and filled with powder, white, brown, or red, and made to look as
      like as possible to a fleece of powdered wool, which <i>battened</i> down
      on each side of the triangle to the face. Then there were things called <i>curls</i>&mdash;nothing
      like what the poets understand by curls or ringlets, but layers of hair,
      first stiffened and then rolled up into hollow cylinders, resembling
      sausages, which were set on each side of the system, "artillery tier above
      tier," two or three of the sausages dangling from the ear down the neck.
      The hair behind, natural and false, plastered together to a preposterous
      bulk with quantum sufficit of powder and pomatum, was turned up in a sort
      of great bag, or club, or <i>chignon</i>&mdash;then at the top of the
      mount of hair and horsehair was laid a gauze platform, stuck full of
      little red daisies, from the centre of which platform rose a plume of
      feathers a full yard high&mdash;or in lieu of platform, flowers, and
      feathers, there was sometimes a fly-cap, or a wing-cap, or a <i>pouf</i>.
      If any one happens to have an old pocket-book for 1780, a single glance at
      the plate of fashionable heads for that year will convey a more competent
      idea of the same than I, unknowing in the terms of art, can produce by the
      most elaborate description. Suffice it for me to observe, that in
      comparison with this head-dress, to which, in my liberality and respect
      for departed fashion, I forbear to fix any of the many epithets which
      present themselves, the Spanish dress and veil worn by Miss Montenero,
      associated as it was with painting and poetry, did certainly appear to me
      more picturesque and graceful. In favour of the veil, I had all the poets,
      from Homer and Hesiod downwards, on my side; and moreover, I was backed by
      the opinion of the wisest of men, who has pronounced that "<i>a veil
      addeth to beauty.</i>" Armed with such authority, and inspired by love, I
      battled stoutly with Lady Anne upon several occasions, especially one
      night when we met at the Pantheon. I was walking between Lady Emily B&mdash;&mdash;
      and Miss Montenero, and two or three times, as we went round the room, we
      met Lady Anne Mowbray and her party, and every time we passed, I observed
      scornful glances at the veil. Berenice was too well-bred to suspect
      ill-breeding in others; she never guessed what was going forward, till one
      of the youngest and boldest of these high-born vulgarians spoke so loud as
      she passed, and pronounced the name of <i>Montenero,</i> and the word <i>Jewess,</i>
      so plainly, that both Miss Montenero and Lady Emily B&mdash;&mdash; could
      not avoid hearing what was said. Lord Mowbray was not with us. I took an
      opportunity of quitting the ladies as soon as general B&mdash;&mdash;, who
      had left us for a few minutes, returned. I went to pay my compliments to
      Lady Anne Mowbray, and, as delicately as I could, remonstrated against
      their proceedings. I said that her ladyship and her party were not aware,
      I was sure, how loudly they had spoken. Lady Anne defended herself and her
      companions by fresh attacks upon the veil, and upon the lady, "who had
      done vastly well to take the veil." In the midst of the nonsense which
      Lady Anne threw out, there now and then appeared something that was a
      little like her brother Mowbray's wit&mdash;little bits of sparkling
      things, <i>mica,</i> not ore. I was in no humour to admire them, and her
      ladyship took much offence at a general observation I made, "that people
      of sense submit to the reigning fashion, while others are governed by it."
      We parted this night so much displeased with each other, that when we met
      again in public, we merely exchanged bows and curtsies&mdash;in private we
      had seldom met of late&mdash;I never went to Lady de Brantefield's. I was
      really glad that the battle of the veil had ended in this cessation of
      intercourse between us. As soon as Miss Montenero found that her Spanish
      dress subjected her to the inconvenience of being remarked in public she
      laid it aside. I thought she was right in so doing&mdash;and in three
      days' time, though I had at first regretted the picturesque dress, I soon
      became accustomed to the change. So easily does the eye adapt itself to
      the fashion, so quickly do we combine the idea of grace and beauty with
      whatever is worn by the graceful and the beautiful, and I may add, so
      certainly do we learn to like whatever is associated with those we love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change of dress which Berenice had so prudently adopted, did not,
      however, produce any change in the manners of Lady Anne and of her party.
      Lady Anne, it was now evident, had taken an unalterable dislike to Miss
      Montenero. I am not coxcomb enough to imagine that she was jealous; I know
      that she never had the slightest regard for me, and that I was not the
      sort of man whom she could like; but still I had been counted, perhaps by
      others, in the list of her admirers, and I was a young man, and an admirer
      the less was always to be regretted&mdash;deserting to a <i>Jewess</i>, as
      she said, was intolerable. But I believe she was also secretly afraid,
      that her brother was more in earnest in his attentions to Miss Montenero,
      than she affected to suppose possible. From whatever cause, she certainly
      hated Berenice cordially, and took every means of mortifying me by the
      display of this aversion. I shall not be at the trouble of recording the
      silly and petty means she took to vex. I was not surprised at any thing of
      this sort from her ladyship; but I was much surprised by her brother's
      continuing to be absolutely blind and deaf to her proceedings. It is true,
      sometimes it happened that he was not present, but this was not always the
      case; and I was convinced that it could not be from accident or
      inadvertency, that it must be from settled design, that he persisted in
      this blindness. Combining my observations, I discovered that he wanted to
      make Miss Montenero feel how impossible it was for her to escape the
      ridicule of certain <i>fashionable impertinents</i>, and how impracticable
      it would be to <i>get on</i> among people of the ton in London, without
      the aid of such a champion as himself. One day he suddenly appeared to
      discover something of what was going forward, and assumed great
      indignation; then affecting to suppress that feeling, "wished to Heaven he
      were <i>authorized</i> to speak"&mdash;and there he paused&mdash;but no
      inclination to authorize him appeared. I had sometimes seen Miss Montenero
      distressed by the rude manner in which she had been stared at. I had seen
      her colour come and go, but she usually preserved a dignified silence on
      such occasions. Once, and but once, I heard her advert to the subject in
      speaking to her father, when Lord Mowbray was not present. "You see, I
      hope, my dear father," said she, "that I am curing myself of that <i>morbid
      sensibility</i>, that excessive susceptibility to the opinion of others,
      with which you used to reproach me. I have had some good lessons, and you
      have had some good trials of me, since we came to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much I am obliged to those persons or those circumstances, which have
      done what I thought was impossible, which have raised my daughter in my
      opinion!" said her father. The look of affectionate approbation with which
      these words were pronounced, and the grateful delight with which Berenice
      heard them, convinced me that Lord Mowbray had completely mistaken his
      ground&mdash;had mistaken strong sensibility for weakness of mind. It now
      appeared, to my entire satisfaction, that Miss Montenero was really and
      truly above the follies and the meanness of fashion. She did not wish to
      be acquainted with these fine people, nor to make a figure in public; but
      she did wish to see the best society in London, in order to compare it
      with what she had been accustomed to in other countries, and to determine
      what would be most for her future happiness. Through the friendship of
      General B&mdash;&mdash; and his family, she had sufficient opportunities
      of seeing in public, and enjoying in private, the best society in London.
      Lord Mowbray, therefore, had no power over her, as a leader of fashion;
      his general character for being a favourite with the ladies, and his
      gallant style of conversation, did not make the impression upon her that
      he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know how to converse with one who could not be answered by a
      play upon words, nor satisfied by an appeal to precedents, or the
      authority of numbers and of high names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Chesterfield's style of conversation, and that of any of the
      personages in Xenophon's Cyropaedia, could not be more different, or less
      compatible, than the simplicity of Miss Montenero and the wit of Lord
      Mowbray.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw any one so puzzled and provoked as was this man of wit by a
      character of genuine simplicity. He was as much out of his element with
      such a character as any of the French lovers in Marmontel's Tales would be
      tte--tte with a Roman or a Grecian matron&mdash;as much at a loss as
      one of the fine gentlemen in Congreve's plays might find himself, if
      condemned to hold parley with a heroine of Sophocles or of Euripides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mowbray, a perfect Proteus when he wished to please, changed his
      manner successively from that of the sentimental lover, to that of the
      polite gallant and accomplished man of the world; and when this did not
      succeed, he had recourse to philosophy, reason, and benevolence. No hint,
      which cunning and address could improve to his purpose, was lost upon
      Mowbray. Mrs. Coates had warned me that Miss Montenero was <i>touchy on
      the Jewish chapter</i>, and his lordship was aware it was as the champion
      of the Jews that I had first been favourably represented by Jacob, and
      favourably received by Mr. Montenero. Soon Lord Mowbray appeared to be
      deeply interested and deeply read in very thing that had been written in
      their favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rummaged over Tovey and Ockley; and "Priestley's Letters to the Jews,"
      and "The Letters of certain Jews to M. de Voltaire," were books which he
      now continually quoted in conversation. With great address he wondered
      that he had never happened to meet with them till lately; and confessed
      that he believed he never should have thought of reading them, but that
      really the subject had of late become so interesting! Of Voltaire's
      illiberal attacks upon the Jews, and of the King of Prussia's intolerance
      towards them, he could not express sufficient detestation; nor could he
      ever adequately extol Cumberland's benevolent "Jew," or Lessing's "Nathan
      the Wise." Quotations from one or the other were continually in readiness,
      uttered with all the air of a man so deeply impressed with certain
      sentiments, that they involuntarily burst from him on every occasion. This
      I could also perceive to be an imitation of what he had seen <i>suceed</i>
      with me; and I was not a little flattered by observing, that Berenice was
      unconsciously pleased, if not caught by the counterfeit. The affectation
      was skilfully managed, with a dash of his own manner, and through the
      whole preserving an air of nature and consistency: so that he had all the
      appearance of a person whose understanding, naturally liberal, had, on one
      particular subject, been suddenly warmed and exalted by the passion of
      love. It has often been said, that liars have need of good memories.
      Mowbray had really an excellent memory, but yet it was not sufficient for
      all his occasions. He contradicted himself sometimes without perceiving
      it, but not without its being perceived. Intent upon one point, he
      laboured that admirably; but he sometimes forgot that any thing could be
      seen beyond that point&mdash;he forgot the bearings and connexions. He
      never forgot his liberality about the Jews, and about every thing relative
      to Hebrew ground; but on other questions, in which he thought Mr.
      Montenero and his daughter had no concern, his party spirit and his want
      of toleration for other sects broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a Rabbi came to Mr. Montenero's while we were there, to solicit
      his contribution towards the building or repairing a synagogue. The priest
      was anxious to obtain leave to build on certain lands which belonged to
      the crown. These lands were in the county where Lord Mowbray's or Lady de
      Brantefield's property lay. With the most engaging liberality of manner,
      Lord Mowbray anticipated the wishes of the Jewish priest, declaring that
      he was happy on this occasion publicly and practically to show his
      principles of toleration; he would immediately use whatever influence he
      might possess with government to obtain the desired grant; and if that
      application should fail, there was still a resource in future. At present,
      unfortunately, his mother's opinions differing from his own, nothing could
      be done; but he could, in future, offer a site for a synagogue in the very
      part of the country that was desired, on lands that must in time be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was down to the ground, bowing, full of acknowledgments, and
      admiration of his lordship's generosity and liberality of principle. A few
      minutes afterwards, however, his lordship undid all he had done with
      Berenice and with her father, by adding that he regretted that his mother
      had given a lease of a bit of land to some confounded dissenters: he was
      determined, he said, whenever the estate should come into his own hands,
      to break that lease&mdash;he would have no meeting-house, no dissenting
      chapel on his estate&mdash;he considered them as nuisances&mdash;he would
      raze the chapel to the ground&mdash;he would much rather have a synagogue
      on that spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mowbray walked to the window with the Jewish priest, who was eager to
      press his own point while his lordship was in the humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mowbray looked back for Mr. Montenero, but, to his evident mortification,
      neither Mr. Montenero nor Berenice followed to this consultation. Mr.
      Montenero turned to me, and, with a peculiar look of his, an expression of
      grave humour and placid penetration, said, "Did you ever hear, Mr.
      Harrington, of a sect of Jews called the Caraites?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>Caraites</i> are what we may call Jewish dissenters. Lord
      Mowbray's notions of toleration remind me of the extraordinary liberality
      of one of our Rabbies, who gave it as his opinion that if a <i>Caraites</i>
      and a Christian were drowning, we Jews ought to make a bridge of the body
      of the Caraite, for the purpose of saving the Christian."
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice smiled; and I saw that my fears of her being duped by mock
      philanthropy were vain. Lord Mowbray was soon tired of his colloquy with
      the priest, and returned to us, talking of the Hebrew chanting at some
      synagogue in town which he had lately visited; and which, he said, was the
      finest thing he had ever heard. A Jewish festival was in a few days to be
      celebrated, and I determined, I said, to go on that day to hear the
      chanting, and to see the ceremony. In the countenance of Berenice, to whom
      my eyes involuntarily turned as I spoke, I saw an indefinable expression,
      on which I pondered, and finished by interpreting favourably to my wishes.
      I settled that she was pleased, but afraid to show this too distinctly.
      Lord Mowbray regretted, what I certainly did not in the least regret, that
      he should be on duty at Windsor on the day of this festival. I was the
      more determined to be at the synagogue, and there accordingly I went
      punctually; but, to my disappointment, Berenice did not appear. Mr.
      Montenero saw me come in, and made room for me near him. The synagogue was
      a spacious, handsome building; not divided into pews like our churches,
      but open, like foreign churches, to the whole congregation. The women sat
      apart in a gallery. The altar was in the centre, on a platform, raised
      several steps and railed round. Within this railed space were the
      high-priest and his assistants. The high-priest with his long beard and
      sacerdotal vestments, struck me as a fine venerable figure. The service
      was in Hebrew: but I had a book with a translation of it. All I recollect
      are the men and women's thanksgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed art thou, O Everlasting King! that thou hast not made me a
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman's lowly response is, "Blessed art thou, O Lord! that thou hast
      made me according to thy will."
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the whole ceremony I must confess that I have but a very confused
      recollection. Many things conspired to distract my attention. Whether it
      was that my disappointment at not seeing Berenice indisposed me to be
      pleased, or whether the chanting was not this day, or at this synagogue,
      as fine as usual, it certainly did not answer my expectations. However
      pleasing it might be to other ears, to mine it was discordant; and I was
      afraid that Mr. Montenero should perceive this. I saw that he observed me
      from time to time attentively, and I thought he wanted to discover whether
      there was within me any remains of my old antipathies. Upon this subject I
      knew he was peculiarly susceptible. Under this apprehension, I did my
      utmost to suppress my feelings; and the constraint became mentally and
      corporeally irksome. The ceremonials, which were quite new to me,
      contributed at once to strain my attention, and to increase the painful
      confusion of my mind. I felt relieved when the service was over; but when
      I thought that it was finished, all stood still, as if in expectation, and
      there was a dead silence. I saw two young children appear from the crowd:
      way was made for them to the altar. They walked slowly, hand in hand, and
      when they had ascended the steps, and approached the altar, the priest
      threw over them a white scarf, or vestment, and they kneeled, and raising
      their little hands, joined them together, in the attitude of supplication.
      They prayed in silence. They were orphans, praying for their father and
      mother, whom they had lately lost. Mr. Montenero told me that it is the
      Jewish custom for orphans, during a year after the death of their parents,
      to offer up at the altar, on every public meeting of their synagogue, this
      solemn commemoration of their loss. While the children were still
      kneeling, a man walked silently round the synagogue, collecting
      contributions for the orphans. I looked, and saw, as he came nearer to me,
      that this was Jacob. Just as I had taken out my purse, I was struck by the
      sight of a face and figure that had terrible power over my associations&mdash;a
      figure exactly resembling one of the most horrible of the Jewish figures
      which used to haunt me when I was a child. The face with <i>terrible eyes</i>
      stood fixed opposite to me. I was so much surprised and startled by this
      apparition, that a nervous tremor seized me in every limb. I let the
      purse, which I had in my hand, fall upon the ground. Mr. Montenero took it
      up again, and presented it to me, asking me, in a very kind voice, "if I
      was ill." I recollected myself&mdash;when I looked again, the figure had
      disappeared in the crowd. I had no reason to believe that Mr. Montenero
      saw the cause of my disorder. He seemed to attribute it to sudden illness,
      and hastened to get out of the synagogue into the fresh air. His manner,
      on this occasion, was so kind towards me, and the anxiety he showed about
      my health so affectionate, that all my fears of his misinterpreting my
      feelings vanished; and to me the result of all that had passed was a
      firmer conviction, than I had ever yet felt, of his regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident, I thought, that after all the disadvantages I had had on
      some points, and after all the pains that Lord Mowbray had taken to
      please, Mr. Montenero far preferred me, and was interested in the highest
      degree about my health, and about every thing that concerned me.
      Nevertheless, Lord Mowbray persevered in showing the most profound respect
      for Mr. Montenero, by acting an increasing taste for his conversation,
      deference for his talents, and affection for his virtues. This certainly
      succeeded better with Berenice than any thing else his lordship had tried;
      but when he found it please, he overdid it a little. The exaggeration was
      immediately detected by Berenice: the heart easily detects flattery. Once,
      when Lord Mowbray praised her father for some accomplishment which he did
      not possess&mdash;for pronouncing and reading English remarkably well&mdash;his
      daughter's glance at the flatterer expressed indignation, suddenly
      extinguished by contempt. Detected and baffled, he did not well know how,
      by a woman whom he considered as so much his inferior in ability and
      address, Lord Mowbray found it often difficult to conceal his real
      feelings of resentment, and then it was that he began to hate her. I, who
      knew his countenance too well to be deceived by his utmost command of
      face, saw the evil turn of the eye&mdash;saw looks from time to time that
      absolutely alarmed me&mdash;looks of hatred, malice, vengeance, suddenly
      changed to smiles, submission, and softness of demeanour. Though extremely
      vain, and possessed with an opinion that no woman could resist him, yet,
      with his understanding and his experience in gallantry, I could not
      conceive it possible that, after all the signs and tokens he had seen, he
      should persist in the hope of succeeding; he was certainly aware that I
      was preferred. I knew it to be natural that jealousy and anger should
      increase with fears and doubts of success; and yet there was something
      incomprehensible in the manner which, before Mr. Montenero, he now adopted
      towards me: he appeared at once to yield the palm to me, and yet to be
      resolved not to give up the contest; he seemed as if he was my rival
      against his will, and my friend if I would but permit it; he refrained,
      with ostentatious care, from giving me any provocation, checking himself
      often, and drawing back with such expressions as these:&mdash;"If it were
      any other man upon earth&mdash;but Mr. Harrington might say and do what he
      pleased&mdash;in any other circumstances, he could not hazard
      contradicting or quarrelling with <i>him</i>; indeed he could never forget&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he would look at Berenice and at Mr. Montenero, and they would look
      as if they particularly approved of his conduct. Berenice softened towards
      him, and I trembled. As she softened towards him, I fancied she became
      graver and more reserved towards me. I was more provoked by the new tone
      of sentimental regret from Mowbray than I had been by any of his other
      devices, because I thought I saw that it imposed more than any thing else
      had done on Berenice and Mr. Montenero, and because I knew it to be so
      utterly false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, as we were going down stairs together, after I had disdainfully
      expressed my contempt of hypocrisy, and my firm belief that my plain truth
      would in the end prevail with Berenice against all his address, he turned
      upon me in sudden anger, beyond his power to control, and exclaimed,
      "Never!&mdash;She never shall be yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared as if he had some trick yet in store&mdash;some card concealed
      in his hand, with which he was secure, at last, of winning the game. I
      pondered, and calculated, but I could not make out what it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      One advantage, as he thought it, I was aware he had over me&mdash;he had
      no religious scruples; he could therefore manage so as to appear to make a
      great sacrifice to love, when, in fact, it would cost his conscience
      nothing. One evening he began to talk of Sir Charles Grandison and
      Clementina&mdash;he blamed Sir Charles Grandison; he declared, that for
      his part <i>there was nothing he would not sacrifice to a woman he loved</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Miss Montenero at that instant&mdash;our eyes met&mdash;she
      blushed deeply&mdash;withdrew her eyes from me&mdash;and sighed. During
      the remainder of the evening, she scarcely spoke to me, or looked toward
      me. She appeared embarrassed; and, as I thought, displeased. Lord Mowbray
      was in high spirits&mdash;he seemed resolved to advance&mdash;I retired
      earlier than usual. Lord Mowbray stayed, and seized the moment to press
      his own suit. He made his proposal&mdash;he offered to sacrifice religion&mdash;every
      thing to love. He was refused irrevocably. I know nothing of the
      particulars, nor should I have known the fact but for his own intemperance
      of resentment. It was not only his vanity&mdash;his mortified, exasperated
      vanity&mdash;that suffered by this refusal; it was not only on account of
      his rivalship with me that he was vexed to the quick; his interest, as
      much as his vanity, had suffered. I did not know till this night how
      completely he was ruined. He had depended upon the fortune of the Jewess.
      What resource for him now?&mdash;None. In this condition, like one of the
      Indian gamblers, when they have lost all, and are ready <i>to run amuck</i>
      on all who may fall in their way, he this night, late, made his appearance
      at a club where he expected to find me. Fortunately, I was not there; but
      a gentleman who was, gave me an account of the scene. Disappointed at not
      finding me, with whom he had determined to quarrel, he supped in absolute
      silence&mdash;drank hasty and deep draughts of wine&mdash;then burst out
      into abuse of Mr. and Miss Montenero, and challenged any body present to
      defend them: he knew that several of their acquaintances were in company;
      but all, seeing that from the combined effects of passion and wine he was
      not in his senses, suffered him to exhale his fury without interruption or
      contradiction. Then he suddenly demanded the reason of this silence; and
      seemingly resolved to force some one into a quarrel, [Footnote: Strange as
      it may appear, this representation is true.] he began by the gentleman
      next to him, and said the most offensive and provoking things he could
      think of to him&mdash;and to each in turn; but all laughed, and told him
      they were determined not to quarrel with him&mdash;that he must take
      four-and-twenty hours to cool before they would take notice of any thing
      he should say. His creditors did not give him four-and-twenty hours' time:
      a servant, before whom he had vented his rage against the Jewess,
      comprehended that all his hopes of her were over, and gave notice to the
      creditors, who kept him in their pay for that purpose. Mowbray was obliged
      the next day to leave town, or to conceal himself in London, to avoid an
      arrest. I heard no more of him for some time&mdash;indeed I made no
      inquiries. I could have no farther interest concerning a man who had
      conducted himself so ill. I only rejoiced that he was now out of my way,
      and that he had by all his treachery, and by all his artifices, given me
      an opportunity of seeing, more fully tried, the excellent understanding
      and amiable disposition of Berenice. My passion was now justified by my
      reason: my hopes were high, not presumptuous&mdash;nothing but the
      difficulty about her religion stood between me and happiness. I was
      persuaded that the change by which I had been alarmed in Miss Montenero's
      manner towards me had arisen only from doubts of my love, or from
      displeasure at the delay of an explicit declaration of my passion.
      Determined, at all hazards, now to try my fate, I took my way across the
      square to Mr. Montenero's&mdash;Across the square?&mdash;yes! I certainly
      took the diagonal of the square.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I arrived at Mr. Montenero's I saw the window-shutters closed, and
      there was an ominous stillness in the area&mdash;no one answered to my
      knock. I knocked louder&mdash;I rang impatiently; no footsteps were heard
      in the hall: I pulled the bell incessantly. During the space of three
      minutes that I was forced to wait on the steps, I formed a variety of
      horrid imaginations. At last I heard approaching sounds: an old woman very
      deliberately opened the door. "Lauk, sir, how you do ring! There's not a
      body to be had but me&mdash;all the servants is different ways, gone to
      their friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Mr. and Miss Montenero&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! they was off by times this morning&mdash;they be gone&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose my look and accent of despair struck the old woman with some
      pity, for she added, "Lauk, sir, they be only gone for a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      I recovered my breath. "And can you, my good lady, tell me where they are
      gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhere down in Surrey&mdash;Lord knows&mdash;I forget the names&mdash;but
      to General somebody's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "General B&mdash;&mdash;'s, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay,&mdash;that's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      My imagination ran over in an instant all the general's family, the gouty
      brother, and the white-toothed aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long are they to stay at General B&mdash;&mdash;'s, can you tell me,
      my good lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear heart! I can't tell, not I's, how they'll cut and carve their
      visitings&mdash;all I know is, they be to be back here in ten days or a
      fortnight or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      I put a golden memorandum, with my card, into the old woman's hand, and
      she promised that the very moment Mr. and Miss Montenero should return to
      town I should have notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this fortnight my anxiety was increased by hearing from Mrs.
      Coates, whom I accidentally met at a fruit-shop, that "Miss Montenero was
      taken suddenly ill of a scarlet fever down in the country at General B&mdash;&mdash;'s,
      where," as Mrs. Coates added, "they could get no advice for her at all,
      but a country apothecary, which was worse than nobody."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coates, who was not an ill-natured, though a very ill-bred woman,
      observing the terrible alarm into which she had thrown me by her
      intelligence, declared she was quite sorry she had <i>outed</i> with the
      news so sudden upon me. Mrs. Coates now stood full in the doorway of the
      fruit-shop, so as to stop me completely from effecting my retreat; and
      while her footman was stowing into her carriage the loads of fruit which
      she had purchased, I was compelled to hear her go on in the following
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Harrington&mdash;no offence&mdash;but I couldn't have conceived
      it was so re'lly over head and ears an affair with you, as by your turning
      as pale as the table-cloth I see it re'lly is. For there was my son Peter,
      he admired her, and the alderman was not against it; but then the Jewess
      connexion was always a stumbling-block Peter could not swallow;&mdash;and
      as for my Lord Mowbray, that the town talked of so much as in love with
      the Jewess heiress&mdash;heiress, says I, very like, but not Jewess, I'll
      engage; and, said I, from the first, he is no more in love with her than I
      am. So many of them young men of the ton is always following of them
      heiresses up and down for fashion or <i>fortin's</i> sake, without caring
      sixpence about them, that&mdash;I ask your pardon, Mr. Harrington&mdash;but
      I thought you might, in the alderman's phrase, be <i>of the same kidney</i>;
      but since I see 'tis a real downright affair of the heart, I shall make it
      my business to call myself at your house to-morrow in my carriage. No&mdash;that
      would look odd, and you a bachelor, and your people out o'town. But I'll
      send my own footman with a message, I promise you now, let 'em be ever so
      busy, if I hear any good news. No need to send if it be bad, for ill news
      flies apace evermore, all the world over, as Peter says. Tom! I say! is
      the fruit all in, Tom?&mdash;Oh! Mr. Harrington, don't trouble yourself&mdash;you're
      too polite, but I always get into my coach best myself, without hand or
      arm, except it be Tom's. A good morning, sir&mdash;I sha'n't forget
      to-morrow: so live upon hope&mdash;lover's fare!&mdash;Home, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Mrs. Coates, more punctual to her word than many a more
      polished person, sent as early as it was possible "to set my heart at ease
      about Miss Montenero's illness, and <i>other</i> <i>matters</i>." Mrs.
      Coates enclosed in her note two letters, which her maid had received that
      morning and last Tuesday. This was the way, as Mrs. Coates confessed, that
      the report reached her ears. The waiting-maid's first letter had stated
      "that her lady, though she did not complain, had a cold and sore throat
      coming down, and this was alarming, with a spotted fever in the
      neighbourhood." Mrs. Coates's maid had, in repeating the news, "turned the
      sore throat into a spotted fever, or a scarlet fever, she did not rightly
      know which, but both were said by the apothecary to be generally fatal,
      where there was any Jewish taint in the blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiting-maid's second epistle, on which Mrs. Coates had written, "<i>a
      sugar plum for a certain gentleman</i>," contained the good tidings "that
      the first was all a mistake. There was no spotted fever, the general's own
      man would take his Bible oath, within ten miles round&mdash;and Miss
      Montenero's throat was gone off&mdash;and she was come out of her room.
      But as to spirits and good looks, she had left both in St. James'-square,
      Lon'on; <i>where her heart was, fur certain</i>. For since she come to the
      country, never was there such a change in any living lady, young or old&mdash;quite
      moped!&mdash;The general, and his aide-de-camp, and every body, noticing
      it at dinner even. To be sure if it did not turn out a <i>match</i>, which
      there was some doubts of, on account of the family's and the old
      gentleman's particular oaths and objections, as she had an inkling of,
      there would be two broken hearts. Lord forbid!&mdash;though a Jewish heart
      might be harder to break than another's, yet it looked likely."
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the letter, Mrs. Coates, or her maid, had very prudently
      torn off. I was now relieved from all apprehensions of spotted fever; and
      though I might reasonably have doubted the accuracy of all the
      intelligence conveyed by such a correspondent, yet I could not help having
      a little faith in some of her observations. My hopes, at least, rose
      delightfully; and with my hope, my ardent impatience to see Berenice
      again. At last, the joyful notice of Mr. and Miss Montenero's return to
      town was brought to me by the old woman. Mr. Montenero admitted me the
      moment I called. Miss Montenero was not at home, or not visible. I was
      shown into Mr. Montenero's study. The moment I entered, the moment I saw
      him, I was struck with some change in his countenance&mdash;some
      difference in his manner of receiving me. In what the difference
      consisted, I could not define; but it alarmed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" I exclaimed, "is Miss Montenero ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter is perfectly well, my dear sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven! But you, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I," said Mr. Montenero, "am also in perfect health. What alarms you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't well know," said I, endeavouring to laugh at myself, and
      my own apprehensions; "but I thought I perceived some change in the
      expression of your countenance towards me, my dear Mr. Montenero. You must
      know, that all my life, my quickness of perception of the slightest change
      in the countenance and manner of those I love, has ever been a curse to
      me; for my restless imagination always set to work to invent causes&mdash;and
      my causes, though ingenious, unluckily, seldom happened to be the real
      causes. Many a vain alarm, many a miserable hour, has this superfluous
      activity of imagination cost me&mdash;so I am determined to cure myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment I was uttering the determination, I stopped short, for I
      felt that I could not keep it, on this occasion. Mr. Montenero sighed, or
      I thought he sighed, and there was such an unusual degree of gravity and
      deliberation in the mildness of his manner, that I could not believe my
      alarm was without cause. I took the chair which he placed for me, and we
      both sat down: but he looked so prepared to listen, that I could not
      articulate. There was a sudden revulsion in my spirits, and all my ideas
      were in utter confusion. Mr. Montenero, the kindness of whose manner was
      not changed towards me, I saw pitied my confusion. He began to talk of his
      excursion into the country&mdash;he spoke of General B&mdash;&mdash; and
      of the whole county of Surrey. The words reached my ears, but conveyed no
      ideas to my mind, except the general notion that Mr. Montenero was giving
      me time to recover myself. I was grateful for the kind intention, and
      somewhat encouraged by the softness of voice, and look of pity. But still
      there was something so measured&mdash;so guarded&mdash;so prepared!&mdash;At
      last, when he had exhausted all that he could say about the county of
      Surrey, and a dead silence threatened me, I took courage, and plunged into
      the middle of things at once. I cannot remember exactly the words, but
      what I said was to this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Montenero, you know so much of the human heart, and of my heart, that
      you must be aware of the cause of my present embarrassment and emotion.
      You must have seen my passion for your incomparable daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen it, I own&mdash;I am well aware of it, Mr. Harrington,"
      replied Mr. Montenero, in a mild and friendly tone; but there was
      something of self-accusation and repentance in the tone, which alarmed me
      inexpressibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, my dear good sir, that you do not repent of your kindness," said
      I, "in having permitted me to cultivate your society, in having indulged
      me in some hours of the most exquisite pleasure I ever yet enjoyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed; and I went on with vehement incoherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you cannot suspect me of a design to abuse your confidence, to
      win, if it were in my power, your daughter's affections, without your
      knowledge, surreptitiously, clandestinely. She is an heiress, a rich
      heiress, I know, and my circumstances&mdash;Believe me, sir, I have never
      intended to deceive you; but I waited till&mdash;There I was wrong. I wish
      I had abided by my own opinion! I wish I had followed my first impulse!
      Believe me, sir, it was my first thought, my first wish, to speak to you
      of all the circumstances; if I delayed, it was from the fear that a
      precipitate declaration would have been imputed to presumption. As Heaven
      is my judge, I had no other motive. I abhor artifice. I am incapable of
      the base treachery of taking advantage of any confidence reposed in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good sir," said Mr. Montenero, when at last I was forced to pause for
      breath, "why this vehemence of defence? I do not accuse&mdash;I do not
      suspect you of any breach of confidence. Pray compose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Calmed by this assurance, I recovered some presence of mind, and
      proceeded, as I thought, in a most tranquil manner to express my regret,
      at all events, that I should not have been the first person to have
      explained to him my unfortunate circumstances. "But this," I said, "was
      like the rest of Lord Mowbray's treacherous conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going on again in a tone of indignation, when Mr. Montenero again
      begged me to compose myself, and asked "to what unfortunate circumstances
      I alluded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not know then? You have not been informed? Then I did Lord Mowbray
      injustice."
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained to Mr. Montenero to what circumstances I had so unintelligibly
      alluded. I gained courage as I went on, for I saw that the history of my
      father's vow, of which Mr. Montenero had evidently never heard till this
      moment, did not shock or offend him, as I had expected that it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the most philosophic calmness and benevolence, he said that he could
      forgive my father for his prejudices the more readily, because he was
      persuaded that if he had ever become known to my father, it would not have
      been impossible to conquer this prepossession.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sighed, for I was convinced this was a vain hope. There was some
      confusion in the tenses in Mr. Montenero's sentence too, which I did not
      quite like, or comprehend; he seemed as if he were speaking of a thing
      that might have been possible, at some time that was now completely past.
      I recollect having a painful perception of this one instant, and the next
      accounting for it satisfactorily, by supposing that his foreign idiom was
      the cause of his confusion of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, he proceeded. "Fortune," said he, "is not an object to me
      in the choice of a son-in-law: considering the very ample fortune which my
      daughter will possess, I am quite at ease upon that point."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though he had cleared away the two first great obstacles, I saw
      there was some greater yet unnamed. I thought it was the difference of our
      religion. We were both silent, and the difficulty seemed to me at this
      moment greater, and more formidable, than it had ever yet appeared. While
      I was considering how I should touch upon the subject, Mr. Montenero
      turned to me and said, "I hate all mysteries, and yet I cannot be
      perfectly explicit with you, Mr. Harrington; as far as I possibly can,
      however, I will speak with openness&mdash;with sincerity, you may depend
      upon it, I have always spoken, and ever shall speak. You must have
      perceived that your company is particularly agreeable to me. Your manners,
      your conversation, your liberal spirit, and the predilection you have
      shown for my society&mdash;the politeness, the humanity, you showed my
      daughter the first evening you met&mdash;and the partiality for her, which
      a father's eye quickly perceived that you felt, altogether won upon my
      heart. My regard for you has been strengthened and confirmed by the
      temper, prudence, and generosity, I have seen you evince towards a rival.
      I have studied your character, and I think I know it as thoroughly as I
      esteem and value it. If I were to choose a son-in-law after my own heart,
      you should be the man. Spare me your thanks&mdash;spare me this joy,"
      continued he; "I have now only said what it was just to say&mdash;just to
      you and to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with difficulty and great emotion, as he went on to say, that he
      feared he had acted very imprudently for my happiness in permitting, in
      encouraging me to see so much of his daughter; for an obstacle&mdash;he
      feared an obstacle that&mdash;His voice almost failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of it," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aware of it?" said he, looking up at me suddenly with astonishment: he
      repeated more calmly, "Aware of it? Let us understand one another, my dear
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you perfectly," cried I. "I am well aware of the nature of
      the obstacle. At once I declare that I can make no sacrifice, no
      compromise of my religious principles, to my passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would be unworthy of my esteem if you could," said Mr. Montenero. "I
      rejoice to hear this declaration unequivocally made; this is what I
      expected from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued I, eagerly, "Miss Montenero could be secure of the free
      exercise of her own religion. You know my principles of toleration&mdash;you
      know my habits; and though between man and wife a difference of religion
      may be in most cases a formidable obstacle to happiness, yet permit me to
      hope&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot permit you to hope," interrupted Mr. Montenero. "You are
      mistaken as to the nature of the obstacle. A difference of religion would
      be a most formidable objection, I grant; but we need not enter upon that
      subject&mdash;that is not the obstacle to which I allude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then of what nature can it be? Some base slander&mdash;Lord Mowbray&mdash;Nothing
      shall prevent me!" cried I, starting up furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently&mdash;command yourself, and listen to reason and truth," said Mr.
      Montenero, laying his hand on my arm. "Am I a man, do you think, to listen
      to base slander? Or, if I had listened to any such, could I speak to you
      with the esteem and confidence with which I have just spoken? Could I look
      at you with the tenderness and affection which I feel for you at this
      instant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mr. Montenero," said I, "you know how to touch me to the heart; but
      answer me one, only one question&mdash;has Lord Mowbray any thing to do
      with this, whatever it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen or heard from him since I saw you last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your word is sufficient," said I. "Then I suspected him unjustly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid," said Mr. Montenero, "that I should raise suspicion in a
      mind which, till now, I have always seen and thought to be above that
      meanness. The torture of suspense I must inflict, but inflict not on
      yourself the still worse torture of suspicion&mdash;ask me no farther
      questions&mdash;I can answer none&mdash;time alone can solve the
      difficulty. I have now to request that you will never more speak to me on
      this subject: as soon as my own mind is satisfied, depend upon it I shall
      let you know it. In the mean time I rely upon your prudence and your
      honour, that you will not declare your attachment to my daughter, that you
      will take no means, direct or indirect, to draw her into any engagement,
      or to win her affections: in short, I wish to see you here as a friend of
      mine&mdash;not a suitor of hers. If you are capable of this necessary
      self-control, continue your visits; but if this effort be beyond your
      power, I charge you, as you regard her happiness and your own, see her no
      more. Consider well, before you decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had confidence in my own strength of mind and honour; I knew that want
      of resolution was not the defect of my character. Difficult as the
      conditions were, I submitted to them&mdash;I promised that if Mr.
      Montenero permitted me to continue my visits, I would strictly comply with
      all he desired. The moment I had given this promise, I was in haste to
      quit the room, lest Berenice should enter, before I had time to recover
      from the excessive agitation into which I had been thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero followed me to the antechamber. "My daughter is not at home&mdash;she
      is taking an airing in the park. One word more before we part&mdash;one
      word more before we quit this painful subject," said he: "do not, my dear
      young friend, waste your time, your ingenuity, in vain conjectures&mdash;you
      will not discover that which I cannot impart; nor would the discovery, if
      made, diminish the difficulty, or in the least add to your happiness,
      though it might to your misery. It depends not on your will to remove the
      obstacle&mdash;by no talents, no efforts of yours can it be obviated: one
      thing, and but one, is in your power&mdash;to command your own mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Command my own mind! Oh! Mr. Montenero, how easy to say&mdash;how
      difficult to command the passions&mdash;such a passion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledge it is difficult, but I hope it is not impossible. We have
      now an opportunity of judging of the strength of your mind, the firmness
      of your resolution, and your power over yourself. Of these we must see
      proofs&mdash;without these you never could be, either with my consent or
      by her own choice, accepted by my daughter, even if no other obstacle
      intervened.&mdash;Adieu." A bright idea, a sudden ray of hope, darted into
      my mind. It might be all intended for a trial of me&mdash;there was,
      perhaps, no real obstacle! But this was only the hope of an instant&mdash;it
      was contradicted by Mr. Montenero's previous positive assertion. I hurried
      home as fast as possible, shut myself up in my own room, and bolted the
      door, that I might not be interrupted. I sat down to think&mdash;I could
      not think, I could only feel. The first thing I did was, as it were, to
      live the whole of the last hour over again&mdash;I recollected every word,
      recalled every look, carefully to impress and record them in my memory. I
      felt that I was not at that moment capable of judging, but I should have
      the means, the facts, safe for a calmer hour. I repeated my recollections
      many times, pausing, and forming vague and often contradictory
      conjectures; then driving them all from my mind, and resolving to think no
      more on this mysterious subject; but on no other subject could I think&mdash;I
      sat motionless. How long I remained in this situation I have no means of
      knowing, but it must have been for some hours, for it was evening, as I
      remember, when I wakened to the sense of its being necessary that I should
      exert myself, and rouse my faculties from this dangerous state of
      abstraction. Since my father and mother had been in the country, I had
      usually dined at taverns or clubs, so that the servants had no concern
      with my hours of meals. My own man was much attached to me, and I should
      have been tormented with his attentions, but that I had sent him out of
      the way as soon as I had come home. I then went into the park, walking
      there as fast and as long as I possibly could. I returned late, quite
      exhausted; hoped I should sleep, and waken with a calmer mind; but I
      believe I had overwalked myself, or my mind had been overstrained&mdash;I
      was very feverish this night, and all the horrors of early association
      returned upon me. Whenever I began to doze, I felt the nervous oppression,
      the dreadful weight upon my chest&mdash;I saw beside my bed the old figure
      of Simon the Jew; but he spoke to me with the voice and in the words of
      Mr. Montenero. The dreams of this night were more terrible than any
      reality that can be conceived; and even when I was broad awake, I felt
      that I had not the command of my mind. My early prepossessions and <i>antipathies</i>,
      my mother's <i>presentiments</i>, and prophecies of evil from the
      connexion with the Monteneros, the prejudices which had so long, so
      universally prevailed against the Jews, occurred to me. I knew all this
      was unreasonable, but still the thoughts obtruded themselves. When the
      light of morning returned, which I thought never would return, I grew
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero's impressive advice, and all the kindness of his look and
      manner, recurred to my mind. The whole of his conduct&mdash;the filial
      affection of Berenice&mdash;the gratitude of Jacob&mdash;the attachment of
      friends, who had known him for years, all assured me of his sincerity
      towards myself; and the fancies, I will not call them suspicions, of the
      night, were dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was determined not to see either Mr. Montenero or Berenice for a few
      days. I knew that the best thing I could do, would be to take strong
      bodily exercise, and totally to change the course of my daily occupations.
      There was an excellent riding-house at this time in London, and I had been
      formerly in the habit of riding there. I was a favourite with the master&mdash;he
      was glad to see me again. I found the exercise, and the immediate
      necessity of suspending all other thoughts to attend to the management of
      my horse, of sovereign use. I thus disciplined my imagination at the time
      when I seemed only to be disciplining an Arabian horse. I question whether
      reading Seneca, or Epictetus, or any moral or philosophic writer, living
      or dead, would have as effectually <i>medicined</i> my mind. While I was
      at the riding-house, General B&mdash;&mdash; came in with some young
      officers. The general, who had distinguished me with peculiar kindness,
      left the young men who were with him, and walked home with me. I refrained
      from asking any questions about Mr. or Miss Montenero's visit at his house
      in Surrey; but he led to the subject himself, and spoke of her having been
      less cheerful than usual&mdash;dwelt on his wish that she and her father
      should settle in England&mdash;said there was a young American, a relation
      of the Manessas, just come over; he hoped there was no intention of
      returning with him to America. I felt a terrible twinge, like what I had
      experienced when the general had first mentioned his brother-in-law&mdash;perhaps,
      said I to myself, it may be as vain. General B&mdash;&mdash; was going to
      speak further on the subject, but though my curiosity was much raised, I
      thought I was bound in honour not to obtain intelligence by any secondary
      means. I therefore requested the general to let us change the subject. He
      tapped my shoulder: "You are right," said he; "I understand your motives&mdash;you
      are right&mdash;I like your principles."
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning from the riding-house, I had the pleasure of hearing that Mr.
      Montenero had called during my absence, and had particularly inquired from
      my own man after my health.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forgot to mention, that in one of the young officers whom I met at the
      riding-house, I recognized a schoolfellow, that very little boy, who,
      mounted upon the step-ladder on the day of Jacob's election, turned the
      election in his favour by the anecdote of the silver pencil-case. My
      little schoolfellow, now a lath of a young man, six feet high, was glad to
      meet me again, and to talk over our schoolboy days. He invited me to join
      him and some of his companions, who were going down to the country on a
      fishing party. They promised themselves great sport in dragging a
      fish-pond. I compelled myself to join this party for the mere purpose of
      changing the course of my thoughts. For three days I was hurried from
      place to place, and not a single thing that I liked to do did I do&mdash;I
      was completely put out of my own way&mdash;my ideas were forced into new
      channels. I heard of nothing but of fishing and fishing-tackle&mdash;of
      the pleasures there would be in the shooting season&mdash;of
      shooting-jackets, and powder-horns, and guns, and <i>proof</i> guns. All
      this was terribly irksome at the time, and yet I was conscious that it was
      of service to me, and I endured it with heroic patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was heartily glad when I got back to town. When I felt that I was able
      to bear the sight of Berenice, I went again to Mr. Montenero's. From that
      hour I maintained my resolution, I strictly adhered to my promise, and I
      felt that I was rewarded by Mr. Montenero's increasing esteem and
      affection. My conversation was now addressed chiefly to him, and I
      remarked that I was always the chief object of his attention. I observed
      that Berenice was much paler, and not in such good spirits as formerly:
      she was evidently under great constraint and anxiety, and the expression
      of her countenance towards me was changed; there was an apprehensiveness,
      which she in vain endeavoured to calm&mdash;her attention to whatever I
      was saying or doing, even when she appeared to be occupied with other
      things, was constant. I was convinced that I was continually in her
      thoughts; I felt that I was not indifferent to her: yet the expression of
      her countenance was changed&mdash;it was not love&mdash;or it was love
      strongly repressed by fear&mdash;by fear!&mdash;was it of her father's
      disapprobation? I had been assured by Mr. Montenero, in whom I had perfect
      confidence, that no power of mine could remove the obstacle, if it existed&mdash;then
      his advice was wise not to waste my thoughts and spirits in vain
      conjectures. As far as it was in human nature, I took his advice,
      repressed my curiosity, and turned my thoughts from that too interesting
      subject. I know not how long I should have maintained my fortitude in this
      passive state of forbearance. Events soon called me again into active
      exertion.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Party spirit, in politics, ran very high about this time in London&mdash;it
      was in the year 1780. The ill success of the American war had put the
      people in ill-humour; they were ready to believe any thing against the
      ministry, and some who, for party purposes, desired to influence the minds
      of the people, circulated the most ridiculous reports, and excited the
      most absurd terrors. The populace were made to believe that the French and
      the papists were secret favourites of government: a French invasion, the
      appearance of the French in London, is an old story almost worn out upon
      the imaginations of the good people of England; but now came a new if not
      a more plausible bugbear&mdash;the Pope! It was confidently affirmed that
      the Pope would soon be in London, he having been seen in disguise in a
      gold-flowered nightgown on <i>St. James's</i> parade at Bath. A poor
      gentleman, who appeared at his door in his nightgown, had been actually
      taken by the Bath mob for the Pope; and they had pursued him with shouts,
      and hunted him, till he was forced to scramble over a wall to escape from
      his pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ludicrous as this may appear, the farce, we all know, soon turned to
      tragedy. From the smallest beginnings, the mischief grew and spread;
      half-a-dozen people gathered in one street, and began the cry of "No
      popery!&mdash;no papists!&mdash;no French!"&mdash;The idle joined the
      idle, and the discontented the discontented, and both were soon drawn in
      to assist the mischievous; and the cowardly, surprised at their own
      prowess, when joined with numbers, and when no one opposed them, grew
      bolder and bolder. Monday morning Mr. Strachan was insulted; Lord
      Mansfield treated it as a slight irregularity. Monday evening Lord
      Mansfield himself was insulted by the mob, they pulled down his house, and
      burnt his furniture. Newgate was attacked next; the keeper went to the
      Lord Mayor, and, at his return, he found the prison in a blaze; that night
      the Fleet, and the King's Bench prisons, and the popish chapels, were on
      fire, and the glare of the conflagration reached the skies. I was heartily
      glad my father and mother were safe in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero and Berenice were preparing to go to a villa in Surrey,
      which he had just purchased; but they apprehended no danger for
      themselves, as they were inoffensive strangers, totally unconnected with
      party or politics. The fury of the mob had hitherto been directed chiefly
      against papists, or persons supposed to favour their cause. The very day
      before Mr. Montenero was to leave town, without any conceivable reason,
      suddenly a cry was raised against the Jews: unfortunately, Jews rhymed to
      shoes: these words were hitched into a rhyme, and the cry was, "<i>No
      Jews, no wooden shoes</i>!" Thus, without any natural, civil, religious,
      moral, or political connexion, the poor Jews came in remainder to the
      ancient anti-Gallican antipathy felt by English feet and English fancies
      against the French wooden shoes. Among the London populace, however, the
      Jews had a respectable body of friends, female friends of noted influence
      in a mob&mdash;the orange-women&mdash;who were most of them bound by
      gratitude to certain opulent Jews. It was then, and I believe it still
      continues to be, a customary mode of charity with the Jews to purchase and
      distribute large quantities of oranges among the retail sellers, whether
      Jews or Christians. The orange-women were thus become their staunch
      friends. One of them in particular, a warm-hearted Irishwoman, whose
      barrow had, during the whole season, been continually replenished by Mr.
      Montenero's bounty, and by Jacob's punctual care, now took her station on
      the steps of Mr. Montenero's house; she watched her opportunity, and when
      she saw <i>the master</i> appear in the hall, she left her barrow in
      charge with her boy, came up the steps, walked in, and addressed herself
      to him thus, in a dialect and tone as new, almost to me, as they seemed to
      be to Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never fear, jewel!&mdash;Jew as you have this day the misfortune to be,
      you're the best Christian any way ever I happened on! so never fear,
      honey, for yourself nor your daughter, God bless her! Not a soul shall go
      near yees, nor a finger be laid on her, good or bad. Sure I know them all&mdash;not
      a mother's son o' the <i>boys</i> but I can call my frind&mdash;not a
      captain or lader that's in it, but I can lade, dear, to the devil and back
      again, if I'd but whistle: so only you keep quite, and don't be
      advertising yourself any way for a Jew, nor be showing your cloven <i>fut</i>,
      with or without the wooden shoes. <i>Keep ourselves to ourselves</i>, for
      I'll tell you a bit of a sacret&mdash;I'm a little bit of a cat'olic
      myself, all as one as what <i>they</i> call a <i>papish</i>; but I keep it
      to myself, and nobody's the wiser nor the worse&mdash;they'd tear me to
      pieces, may be, did they suspect <i>the like</i>, but I keep never
      minding, and you, jewel, do the like. They call you a Levite, don't they?
      then I, the Widow Levy, has a good right to advise ye; we were all
      brothers and sisters once&mdash;no offence&mdash;in the time of Adam,
      sure, and we should help one another in all times. 'Tis my turn to help <i>yees</i>
      now, and, by the blessing, so I will&mdash;accordingly I'll be sitting all
      day and night, mounting guard on your steps there without. And little as
      you may think of me, the devil a guardian angel better than myself, only
      just the Widow Levy, such as ye see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Widow Levy took her stand, and kept her word. I stayed at Mr.
      Montenero's all day, saw every thing that passed, and had frequent
      opportunities of admiring her address.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began by making the footman take down "the outlandish name from off
      the door; for no name at all, sure, was better <i>nor</i> a foreign name
      these times." She charged the footman to "say <i>sorrow</i> word
      themselves to the mob for their lives, in case they would come; but to
      lave it all entirely to her, that knew how to spake to <i>them</i>. For
      see!" said she, aside to me&mdash;"For see! them powdered numskulls would
      spoil all&mdash;they'd be taking it too high or too low, and never hit the
      right <i>kay</i>, nor mind when to laugh or cry in the right place;
      moreover, when they'd get <i>frighted</i> with a cross-examination, they'd
      be apt to be <i>cutting</i> themselves. Now, the ould one himself, if he
      had me <i>on the table</i> even, I'd defy to get the truth out of me, if
      not convanient, and I in the sarvice of a frind."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pleasure of telling a few superfluous lies it seemed to be
      necessary that our guardian angel should be indulged; and there she sat on
      the steps quite at ease, smoking her pipe, or wiping and <i>polishing</i>
      her oranges. As parties of the rioters came up, she would parley and jest
      with them, and by alternate wit and humour, and blunder, and bravado, and
      flattery, and <i>fabling</i>, divert their spirit of mischief, and forward
      them to distant enterprise. In the course of the day, we had frequent
      occasion to admire her intrepid ingenuity and indefatigable zeal. Late at
      night, when all seemed perfectly quiet in this part of the town, she, who
      had never stirred from her post all day, was taken into the kitchen by the
      servants to eat some supper. While she was away, I was standing at an open
      window of the drawing-room, watching and listening&mdash;all was silence;
      but suddenly I heard a shriek, and two strange female figures appeared
      from the corner of the square, hurrying, as if in danger of pursuit,
      though no one followed them. One was in black, with a hood, and a black
      cloak streaming behind; the other in white, neck and arms bare, head full
      dressed, with high feathers blown upright. As they came near the window at
      which I stood, one of the ladies called out, "Mr. Harrington! Mr.
      Harrington! For Heaven's sake let us in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Anne Mowbray's voice! and Lady de Brantefield!" cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly, before I could pass her, Berenice ran down stairs, unlocked&mdash;threw
      open the hall-door, and let them in. Breathless, trembling so that they
      could not speak, they sunk upon the first seat they could reach; the
      servants hearing the hall-door unchained, ran into the hall, and when sent
      away for water, the three footmen returned with each something in his
      hand, and stood with water and salvers as a pretence to satisfy their
      curiosity; along with them came the orange-woman, who, wiping her mouth,
      put in her head between the footmen's elbows, and stood listening, and
      looking at the two ladies with no friendly eye. She then worked her way
      round to me, and twitching my elbow, drew me back, and whispered&mdash;"What
      made ye let 'em in? Take care but one's a mad woman, and t'other a bad
      woman." Lady Anne, who had by this time drank water, and taken hartshorn,
      and was able to speak, was telling, though in a very confused manner, what
      had happened. She said that she had been dressed for the opera&mdash;the
      carriage was at the door&mdash;her mother, who was to set her down at Lady
      Somebody's, who was to <i>chaperon</i> her, had just put on her hood and
      cloak, and was coming down stairs, when they heard a prodigious noise of
      the mob in the street. The mob had seized their carriage&mdash;and had
      found in one of the pockets a string of beads, which had been left there
      by the Portuguese ambassador's lady, whom Lady De Brantefield had taken
      home from chapel the preceding day. The mob had seen the carriage stop at
      the chapel, and the lady and her confessor get into it; and this had led
      to the suspicion that Lady de Brantefield was a catholic, or in their
      language, a concealed <i>papist</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On searching the carriage farther, they had found a breviary, and one of
      them had read aloud the name of a priest, written in the beginning of the
      book&mdash;a priest whose name was peculiarly obnoxious to some of the
      leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they found the breviary, and the rosary, and this priest's
      name, the mob grew outrageous, broke the carriage, smashed the windows of
      the house, and were bursting open the door, when, as Lady Anne told us,
      she and her mother, terrified almost out of their senses, escaped through
      the back door <i>just in the dress they were</i>, and made their way
      through the stables, and a back lane, and a cross street: still hearing,
      or fancying they heard, the shouts of the mob, they had run on without
      knowing how, or where, till they found themselves in this square, and saw
      me at the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? Tell me, dear," whispered the orange-woman, drawing me back
      behind the footman. "Tell me, for I can't understand her for looking at
      the figure of her. Tell me plain, or it may be the ruen of yees all before
      ye'd know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated Lady Anne's story, and from me the orange-woman understood it;
      and it seemed to alarm her more than any of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are they <i>Romans?</i>" (Roman Catholics) said she. "How is that,
      when they're not Irish!&mdash;for I'll swear to their not being Irish,
      tongue or pluck. I don't believe but they're impostors&mdash;no right <i>Romans</i>,
      sorrow bit of the likes; but howsomdever, no signs of none following them
      yet&mdash;thanks above! Get rid on 'em any way as smart as ye can, dear;
      tell Mr. Montenero."
    </p>
    <p>
      As all continued perfectly quiet, both in the back and front of the house,
      we were in hopes that they would not be pursued or discovered by the mob.
      We endeavoured to quiet and console them with this consideration; and we
      represented that, if the mob should break into their house, they would,
      after they had searched and convinced themselves that the obnoxious priest
      was not concealed there, disperse without attempting to destroy or pillage
      it "Then," said Lady de Brantefield, rising, and turning to her daughter,
      "Lady Anne, we had better think of returning to our own house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though well aware of the danger of keeping these suspected ladies this
      night, and though our guardian angel repeatedly twitched us, reiterating,
      "Ah! let 'em go&mdash;don't be keeping 'em!" yet Mr. Montenero and
      Berenice pressed them, in the kindest and most earnest manner, to stay
      where they were safe. Lady Anne seemed most willing, Lady de Brantefield
      most unwilling to remain; yet her fears struggled with her pride, and at
      last she begged that a servant might be sent to her house to see how
      things were going on, and to order chairs for her, if their return was
      practicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" cried the orange-woman, laying a strong detaining hand on the
      footman's arm; "stop you&mdash;'tis I'll go with more sense&mdash;and
      speed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that person&mdash;that woman?" cried Lady de Brantefield, who now
      heard and saw the orange-woman for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman!&mdash;is it me she manes?" said the orange-woman, coming forward
      quite composedly, shouldering on her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it who I am?&mdash;I'm the Widow Levy.&mdash;Any commands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did she get in?" continued Lady de Brantefield, still with a look of
      mixed pride and terror: "how did she get in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very asy!&mdash;through the door&mdash;same way you did, my lady, if ye
      had your senses. Where's the wonder? But what commands?&mdash;don't be
      keeping of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anne!&mdash;Lady Anne!&mdash;Did she follow us in?" said Lady de
      Brantefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow yees!&mdash;not I!&mdash;no follower of yours nor the likes. But
      what commands, nevertheless?&mdash;I'll do your business the night, for
      the sake of them I love in my heart's core," nodding at Mr. and Miss
      Montenero; "so, my lady, I'll bring ye word, faithful, how it's going with
      ye at home&mdash;which is her house, and where, on God's earth?" added
      she, turning to the footmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my satisfaction be the object, sir, or madam," said Lady de
      Brantefield, addressing herself with much solemnity to Mr. and Miss
      Montenero, "I must take leave to request that a fitter messenger be sent;
      I should, in any circumstances, be incapable of trusting to the
      representations of such a person."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fury of the orange-woman kindled&mdash;her eyes flashed fire&mdash;her
      arms a-kimbo, she advanced repeating, "Fitter!&mdash;Fitter!&mdash;What's
      that ye say?&mdash;You're not Irish&mdash;not a bone in your skeleton!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne screamed. Mr. Montenero forced the orange-woman back, and
      Berenice and I hurried Lady de Brantefield and her daughter across the
      hall into the eating-room. Mr. Montenero followed an instant afterwards,
      telling Lady de Brantefield that he had despatched one of his own servants
      for intelligence. Her ladyship bowed her head without speaking. He then
      explained why the orange-woman happened to be in his house, and spoke of
      the zeal and ability with which she had this day served us. Lady de
      Brantefield continued at intervals to bow her head while Mr. Montenero
      spoke, and to look at her watch, while Lady Anne, simpering, repeated,
      "Dear, how odd!" Then placing herself opposite to a large mirror, Lady
      Anne re-adjusted her dress. That settled, she had nothing to do but to
      recount her horrors over again. Her mother, lost in reverie, sat
      motionless. Berenice, meantime, while the messenger was away, made the
      most laudable and kind efforts, by her conversation, to draw the attention
      of her guests from themselves and their apprehensions; but apparently
      without effect, and certainly without thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, Berenice and her father being called out of the room, I was
      left alone with Lady de Brantefield and Lady Anne: the mother broke
      silence, and turning to the daughter, said, in a most solemn tone of
      reproach, "Anne! Lady Anne Mowbray!&mdash;how could you bring me into this
      house of all others&mdash;a Jew's&mdash;when you know the horror I have
      always felt&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, mamma! I declare I was so terrified, I didn't know one house from
      another. But when I saw Mr. Harrington, I was so delighted I never thought
      about it's being <i>the Jew's</i> house&mdash;and what matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What matter!" repeated Lady de Brantefield: "are you my daughter, and a
      descendant of Sir Josseline de Mowbray, and ask what matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear mamma, that's the old story! that's so long ago!&mdash;How can you
      think of such old stuff at such a time as this? I'm sure I was frightened
      out of my wits&mdash;I forgot even my detestation of&mdash;&mdash;But I
      must not say that before Mr. Harrington. But now I see the house, and <i>all
      that,</i> I don't wonder at him so much; I declare it's a monstrous
      handsome house&mdash;as rich as a Jew! I'm sure I hope those wretches will
      not destroy <i>our</i> house&mdash;and, oh! the great mirror, mamma!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Miss Montenero returned with much concern in their countenances:
      they announced that the messenger had brought word that the mob were
      actually pulling down Lady de Brantefield's house&mdash;that the furniture
      had all been dragged out into the street, and that it was now burning.
      Pride once more gave way to undisguised terror in Lady de Brantefield's
      countenance, and both ladies stood in speechless consternation. Before we
      had time to hear or to say more, the orange-woman opened the door, and
      putting in her head, called out in a voice of authority, "Jantlemen,
      here's one wants yees, admits of no delay; lave all and come out, whether
      you will or no, the minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      We went out, and with an indescribable gesture, and wink of satisfaction,
      the moment she had Mr. Montenero and me in the hall, she said in a
      whisper, "'Tis only myself, dears, but 'tis I am glad I got yees out away
      from being bothered by the presence of them women, whiles ye'd be settling
      all for life or death, which we must now do&mdash;for don't be nursing and
      dandling yourselves in the notion that <i>the boys</i> will not be wid ye.
      It's a folly to talk&mdash;they will; my head to a China orange they will,
      now: but take it asy, jewels&mdash;we've got an hour's law&mdash;they've
      one good hour's work first&mdash;six garrets to gut, where they are, and
      tree back walls, with a piece of the front, still to pull down. Oh! I
      larnt all. He is a <i>'cute</i> lad you sent, but not being used to it,
      just went and ruined and murdered us all by what he let out! What do ye
      tink? But when one of the boys was questioning him who he belonged to, and
      what brought him in it, he got frighted, and could think of noting at all
      but the truth to tell: so they've got the scent, and they'll follow the
      game. Ogh! had I been my own messenger, in lieu of minding that woman
      within, I'd have put 'em off the scent. But it's past me now&mdash;so what
      next?" While Mr. Montenero and I began to consult together, she went on&mdash;"I'll
      tell you what you'll do: you'll send for two chairs, or one&mdash;less
      suspicious, and just get the two in asy, the black one back, the white
      for'ard, beca'ase she's coming nat'ral from the Opera&mdash;if stopped,
      and so the chairmen, knowing no more than Adam who they would be carrying,
      might go through the thick of the boys at a pinch safe enough, or round
      any way, sure; they know the town, and the short cuts, and set 'em down (a
      good riddance!) out of hand, at any house at all they mention, who'd
      resave them of their own frinds, or kith and kin&mdash;for, to be sure, I
      suppose they <i>have</i> frinds, tho' I'm not one. You'll settle with them
      by the time it's come, where they'll set down, and I'll step for the
      chair, will I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mr. Montenero, "not unless it be the ladies' own desire to go:
      I cannot turn them out of my house, if they choose to stay; at all hazards
      they shall have every protection I can afford. Berenice, I am sure, will
      think and feel as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero returned to the drawing-room, to learn the determination of
      his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There goes as good a Christian!" cried the Widow Levy, holding up her
      forefinger, and shaking it at Mr. Montenero the moment his back was
      turned: "didn't I tell ye so from the first? Oh! if he isn't a jewel of a
      Jew!&mdash;and the daughter the same!" continued she, following me as I
      walked up and down the hall: "the kind-hearted cratur, how tinder she
      looked at the fainting Jezabel&mdash;while the black woman turning from
      her in her quality scowls.&mdash;Oh! I seed it all, and with your own
      eyes, dear&mdash;but I hope they'll go&mdash;and once we get a riddance of
      them women. I'll answer for the rest. Bad luck to the minute they come
      into the house! I wish the jantleman would be back&mdash;Oh! here he is&mdash;and
      will they go, jewel?" cried she, eagerly. "The ladies will stay," said Mr.
      Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder!&mdash;but you can't help it&mdash;so no more about it&mdash;but
      what arms have ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No arms were to be found in the house but a couple of swords, a pair of
      pistols of Mr. Montenero's, and one gun, which had been left by the former
      proprietor. Mr. Montenero determined to write immediately to his friend
      General B&mdash;, to request that a party of the military might be sent to
      guard his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, so best, send for the dragoons, the only thing left on earth for us
      now: but don't let 'em fire on <i>the boys</i>&mdash;disperse 'em with the
      horse, asy, ye can, without a shot; so best&mdash;I'll step down and feel
      the pulse of all below."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Montenero wrote, Berenice, alarmed for her father, stood leaning
      on the back of his chair, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mr. Harrington! Mr. Harrington!" repeated Lady Anne, "what will
      become of us! If Colonel Topham was but here! Do send to the Opera, pray,
      pray, with <i>my</i> compliments&mdash;Lady Anne Mowbray's compliments&mdash;he'll
      come directly, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That my son, Lord Mowbray, should be out of town, how extraordinary and
      how unfortunate!" cried Lady de Brantefield, "when we might have had his
      protection, his regiment, without applying to strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up and down the room with the air of a princess in chains. The
      orange-woman bolted into the room, and pushed past her ladyship, while Mr.
      Montenero was sealing his note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it, jewel!&mdash;It's I'll be the bearer; for all your powdered men
      below has taken fright by the dread the first messenger got, and dares not
      be carrying a summons for the military through the midst of <i>them</i>:
      but I'll take it for yees&mdash;and which way will I go to get quickest to
      your general's? and how will I know his house?&mdash;for seven of them
      below bothered my brains."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero repeated the direction&mdash;she listened coolly, then
      stowing the letter in her bosom, she stood still for a moment with a look
      of deep deliberation&mdash;her head on one side, her forefinger on her
      cheek-bone, her thumb under her chin, and the knuckle of the middle-finger
      compressing her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, now, <i>they'll</i> be apt to come up the stable lane for the back
      o' the house, and another party of them will be in the square, in front;
      so how will it be with me to get into the house to yees again, without
      opening the doors for <i>them</i>, in case they are wid <i>ye</i> afore
      I'd get the military up?&mdash;I have it," cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rushed to the door, but turned back again to look for her pipe, which
      she had laid on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's my pipe?&mdash;Lend it me&mdash;What am I without my pipe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The savage!" cried Lady de Brantefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fool!" said Lady Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Widow Levy nodded to each of the two ladies, as she lit the pipe
      again, but without speaking to them, turned to us, and said, "If the boys
      would meet me without my pipe, they'd not know me; or smell something odd,
      and guess I was on some unlawful errand."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she passed Berenice and me, who were standing together, she hastily
      added, "Keep a good heart, sweetest!&mdash;At the last push, you have one
      will shed the heart's drop for ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick, scarcely perceptible motion of her eye towards me marked her
      meaning; and one involuntary look from Berenice at that moment, even in
      the midst of alarm, spread joy through my whole frame. In the common
      danger we were drawn closer together&mdash;we <i>thought</i> together;&mdash;I
      was allowed to help her in the midst of the general bustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary, as quickly as possible, to determine what articles in
      the house were of most value, and to place these in security. It was
      immediately decided that the pictures were inestimable.&mdash;What was to
      be done with them? Berenice, whose presence of mind never forsook her, and
      whose quickness increased with the occasion, recollected that the
      unfinished picture-gallery, which had been built behind the house,
      adjoining to the back drawing-room, had no window opening to the street:
      it was lighted by a sky-light; it had no communication with any of the
      apartments in the house, except with the back drawing-room, into which it
      was intended to open by large glass doors; but fortunately these were not
      finished, and, at this time, there was no access to the picture-gallery
      but by a concealed door behind the gobelin tapestry of the back
      drawing-room&mdash;an entrance which could hardly be discovered by any
      stranger. In the gallery were all the plasterers' trestles, and the
      carpenters' lumber; however, there was room soon made for the pictures:
      all hands were in motion, every creature busy and eager, except Lady de
      Brantefield and her daughter, who never offered the smallest assistance,
      though we were continually passing with our loads through the front
      drawing-room, in which the two ladies now were. Lady Anne standing up in
      the middle of the room looked like an actress ready dressed for some
      character, but without one idea of her own. Her mind, naturally weak, was
      totally incapacitated by fear: she kept incessantly repeating as we passed
      and repassed, "Bless me! one would think the day of judgment was coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady de Brantefield all the time sat in the most remote part of the room,
      fixed in a huge arm-chair. The pictures and the most valuable things were,
      by desperately hard work, just stowed into our place of safety, when we
      heard the shouts of the mob, at once at the back and front of the house,
      and soon a thundering knocking at the hall-door. Mr. Montenero and I went
      to the door, of course without opening it, and demanded, in a loud voice,
      what they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We require the papists," one answered for the rest, "the two women
      papists and the priest you've got within, to be given up, for your lives!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no priest here&mdash;there are no papists here:&mdash;two
      protestant ladies, strangers to me, have taken refuge here, and I will not
      give them up," said Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we'll pull down the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The military will be here directly," said Mr. Montenero, coolly; "you had
      better go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The military!&mdash;then make haste, boys, with the work."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a general cry of "No papists!&mdash;no priests!&mdash;no Jews!&mdash;no
      wooden shoes!" they began with a volley of stones against the windows. I
      ran to see where Berenice was. It had been previously agreed among us,
      that she and her guests, and every female in the house, should, on the
      first alarm, retire into a back room; but at the first shout of the mob,
      Lady de Brantefield lost the little sense she ever possessed: she did not
      faint, but she stiffened herself in the posture in which she sat, and with
      her hands turned down over the elbows of the huge chair, on which her arms
      were extended, she leaned back in all the frightful rigidity of a corpse,
      with a ghastly face, and eyes fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice, in vain, tried to persuade her to move. Her ideas were
      bewildered or concentrated. Only the obstinacy of pride remained alive
      within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, "she would never move from that spot&mdash;she would not
      be commanded by Jew or Jewess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you hear the mob&mdash;the stones at the windows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. They would all pay for it on the scaffold or the gibbet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if they break in here you will be torn to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;those only will be sacrificed who <i>have sacrificed</i>. A 'de
      Brantefield'&mdash;they dare not!&mdash;I shall not stir from this spot.
      Who will presume to touch Lady de Brantefield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero and I lifted up the huge chair on which she sat, and carried
      her and it into the back room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of this room was scarcely shut, and the tapestry covering but
      just closed over the entrance into the picture-gallery, when there was a
      cry from the hall, and the servants came rushing to tell us that one of
      the window-shutters had given way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero, putting the pistols into my hand, took the gun, ran down
      stairs, and stationed himself so as to defend the entrance to the window,
      at which the people were pelting with stones; declaring that he would fire
      on the first man who should attempt to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man leaped in, and, in the struggle, Mr. Montenero's gun was wrested
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my presenting a pistol, the man scrambled out of the window, carrying
      away with him the prize he had seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the faithful Jacob appeared amongst us as if by miracle.
      "Master, we are safe," said he, "if we can defend ourselves for a few
      minutes. The orange-woman delivered your letter, and the military are
      coming. She told me how to get in here, through the house that is building
      next door, from the leads of which I crept through a trap-door into your
      garret."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the pistols, and with the assistance of the servants who were armed,
      some of them with swords, and others with whatever weapons came to hand,
      we made such a show of resistance as to keep the mob at bay for some
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark!" cried Jacob; "thank Heaven, there's the military!" There was a
      sudden cessation of stones at the window. We heard the joyful sound of the
      horses' hoofs in the street. A prodigious uproar ensued, then gradually
      subsided. The mob was dispersed, and fled in different directions, and the
      military followed. We heard them gallop off. We listened till not a sound,
      either of human voice or of horse's foot, was to be heard. There was
      perfect silence; and when we looked as far as our eyes could reach out of
      the broken window, there was not a creature to be seen in the square or in
      the line of street to which it opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ran to let out our female prisoners; I thought only of Berenice&mdash;she,
      who had shown so much self-possession during the danger, seemed most
      overpowered at this moment of joy; she threw her arms round her father,
      and held him fast, as if to convince herself that he was safe. Her next
      look was for me, and in her eyes, voice, and manner, when she thanked me,
      there was an expression which transported me with joy; but it was checked,
      it was gone the next moment: some terrible recollection seemed to cross
      her mind. She turned from me to speak to that odious Lady de Brantefield.
      I could not see Mr. Montenero's countenance, for he, at the same instant,
      left us, to single out, from the crowd assembled in the hall, the poor
      Irishwoman, whose zeal and intrepid gratitude had been the means of our
      deliverance. I was not time enough to hear what Mr. Montenero said to her,
      or what reward he conferred; but that the reward was judicious, and that
      the words were grateful to her feelings in the highest degree, I had full
      proof; for when I reached the hall, the widow was on her knees, with hands
      uplifted to Heaven, unable to speak, but with tears streaming down her
      hard face: she wiped them hastily away, and started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not a little thing brings me to this," said she; "none ever drew a
      tear from my eyes afore, since the boy I lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew the hood of her cloak over her head, and pushed her way through
      the servants to get out of the hall-door; I unbolted and unchained it for
      her, and as I was unlocking it, she squeezed up close to me, and laying
      her iron hand on mine, said in a whisper, "God bless yees! and don't
      forget my thanks to the sweet <i>Jewish</i>&mdash;I can't speak 'em now,
      'tis you can best, and joined in my prayers ye shall ever be!" said our
      guardian angel, as I opened the door; and as she passed out, she added,
      "You are right, jewel&mdash;she's worth all the fine ladies in Lon'on,
      feathers an' all in a bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had long been entirely of the Widow Levy's opinion, though the mode of
      expression would never have occurred to me. What afterwards became of Lady
      Anne and of her mother this night, I do not distinctly recollect. Lady de
      Brantefield, when the alarm was over, I believe, recovered her usual
      portion of sense, and Lady Anne her silly spirits; but neither of them, I
      know, showed any feeling, except for themselves. I have an image of Lady
      de Brantefield standing up, and making, at parting, such ungracious
      acknowledgments to her kind hostess and generous protector, as her pride
      and her prejudices would permit. Both their ladyships seemed to be in a
      hurry to get out of the house, and I know that I rejoiced in their
      departure. I was in hopes of one moment, one explanatory word or look from
      Berenice. She was retiring to her own apartment, as I returned, with her
      father, after putting those two women into their carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am now quite convinced," said Mr. Montenero, smiling, "that Mr.
      Harrington never could have been engaged or attached to Lady Anne
      Mowbray."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible you ever imagined?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not <i>imagine</i>, I only heard and believed&mdash;and now I have
      seen, and I disbelieve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is this the obstacle, the invincible obstacle?" cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice sighed, and walked on to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish it were!" said Mr. Montenero; "but I pray you, sir, do not speak,
      do not think of this to-night&mdash;farewell! we all want repose."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not think that I wanted repose till the moment I lay down in bed,
      and then, overpowered with bodily fatigue, I fell into a profound sleep,
      from which I did not awaken till late the next morning, when my man,
      drawing back my curtains, presented to me a note from&mdash;I could hardly
      believe my eyes&mdash;"from Miss Montenero"&mdash;from Berenice! I started
      up, and read these words written in pencil: "My father is in danger&mdash;come
      to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      How quick I was in obeying may be easily imagined. I went well armed, but
      in the present danger arms were of no use. I found that Mr. Montenero was
      summoned before one of the magistrates, on a charge of having fired from
      his window the preceding night before the Riot Act had been read&mdash;of
      having killed an inoffensive passenger. Now the fact was, that no shot had
      ever been fired by Mr. Montenero; but such was the rage of the people at
      the idea that the <i>Jew</i> had killed a Christian, and one of their
      party, that the voice of truth could not be heard. They followed with
      execrations as he was carried before the magistrate; and waited with
      impatience, assembled round the house, in hopes of seeing him committed to
      prison to take his trial for murder. As I was not ignorant of the
      substantial nature of the defence which the spirit and the forms of
      English law provide in all cases for truth and innocence, against false
      accusation and party prejudice, I was not alarmed at the clamour I heard;
      I was concerned only for the temporary inconvenience and mortification to
      Mr. Montenero, and for the alarm to Berenice. The magistrate before whom
      Mr. Montenero appeared was an impartial and very patient man: I shall not
      so far try the patience of others as to record all that was positively
      said, but which could not be sworn to&mdash;all that was offered in
      evidence, but which contradicted itself, or which could not be
      substantiated by any good witness&mdash;at length one creditable-looking
      man came forward against Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he was an ironmonger&mdash;that he had been passing by at the time
      of the riot, and had been hurried along by the crowd against his will to
      Mr. Montenero's house, where he saw a sailor break open the window-shutter
      of one of the lower rooms&mdash;that he saw a shot fired by Mr. Montenero&mdash;that
      the sailor, after a considerable struggle, wrested the gun, with which the
      shot had been fired, from Mr. Montenero, and retreated with it from the
      window&mdash;that hearing the cry of murder in the crowd, he thought it
      proper to secure the weapon, that it might be produced in evidence&mdash;and
      that the piece which he now produced was that which had been taken from
      Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived great concern in the countenance of the magistrate, who,
      addressing himself to Mr. Montenero, asked him what he had to say in his
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Mr. Montenero, "I acknowledge that to be the gun which was
      wrested from my hands by the sailor; and I acknowledge that I attempted
      with that gun to defend my family and my house from immediate violence; I
      am, however," continued he, "happy to have escaped having injured any
      person, even in the most justifiable cause, for the piece did not go off,
      it only flashed in the pan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that be the case," said the magistrate, "the piece is still loaded."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gun was tried, and it was found to be empty both of powder and ball.
      As the magistrate returned the piece to the man, I came forward and asked
      leave to examine it. I observed to the magistrate, that if the piece had
      been fired, the inside of the barrel must retain marks of the discharge,
      whereas, on the contrary, the inside of the barrel was perfectly smooth
      and clean. To this the man replied, that he had cleaned the piece when he
      brought it home, which might indeed have been true. At this moment, I
      recollected a circumstance that I had lately heard from the officers in
      the country, who had been talking about a fowling-piece, and of the
      careless manner in which fire-arms are sometimes proved [Footnote: See
      Manton on Gunnery.]. Upon examination, I found that what I suspected might
      be just possible was actually the case with respect to the piece in
      question&mdash;the touch-hole had never been bored through, though the
      piece was marked as <i>proof</i>! I never shall forget the satisfaction
      which appeared in the countenance of the humane magistrate, who from the
      beginning had suspected the evidence, whom he knew from former
      delinquency. The man was indeed called an ironmonger, but his was one of
      those <i>old iron shops</i> which were known to be receptacles of stolen
      goods of various descriptions. To my surprise, it now appeared that this
      man's name was Dutton: he was the very Dutton who had formerly been
      Jacob's rival, and who had been under Lord Mowbray's protection. Time and
      intemperance had altered him so much, that I had not, till I heard his
      name, the slightest recollection of his face. What his motive for
      appearing against Mr. Montenero might be, whether it was hatred to him as
      being the patron of Jacob, whom Dutton envied and detested, or whether
      Dutton was instigated by some other and higher person, I shall not now
      stop to inquire. As he had not been put upon his oath, he had not been
      guilty of perjury; he was discharged amidst the hootings of the mob.
      Notwithstanding their prejudice against the Jews, and their rage against a
      Jew who had harboured, as they conceived, two <i>concealed</i> papists and
      a priest, yet the moment an attempt to bear false witness against Mr.
      Montenero appeared, the people took his part. In England the mob is always
      in favour of truth and innocence, wherever these are made clearly evident
      to their senses. Pleased with themselves for their impartiality, it was
      not difficult at this moment for me to convince them, as I did, that Mr.
      Montenero had not harboured either papists or priest. The mob gave us
      three cheers. As we passed through the crowd, I saw Jacob and the
      orange-woman&mdash;the orange-woman, with broad expanded face of joy,
      stretched up her arms, and shouted loud, that all the mob might hear.
      Jacob, little accustomed to sympathy, and in the habit of repressing his
      emotions, stood as one unmoved or dumb, till his eyes met mine, and then
      suddenly joy spread over his features and flashed from his dark eyes&mdash;that
      was a face of delight I never can forget; but I could not stay: I hastened
      to be the first to tell Berenice of her father's safety, and of the proof
      which all the world had had of the falsehood of the charge against him. I
      ran up to the drawing-room, where she was alone. She fainted in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now you think, that when she came to herself, there was an end of all
      my fears, all my suspense&mdash;you think that her love, her gratitude,
      overcame the objection, whatever it may be, which has hitherto been called
      invincible&mdash;alas! you are mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to resign Berenice to the care of her attendants. A short
      time afterwards I received from her father the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My obligations to you are great, so is my affection for you; but the
      happiness of my child, as well as your happiness, is at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not trust my gratitude&mdash;my daughter and you must never meet
      again, or must meet to part no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot yet decide: if I shall be satisfied that the obstacle do not
      exist, she shall be yours; if it do exist, we sail the first of next month
      for America, and you, Mr. Harrington, will not be the only, or perhaps the
      most, unhappy person of the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A. MONTENERO."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Sunday after the riots, I happened to see Mrs. Coates, as we were
      coming out of St. George's church. She was not in full-blown, happy
      importance, as formerly: she looked ill and melancholy; or, as one of her
      city neighbours, who was following her out of church, expressed it, quite
      "crest-fallen." I heard some whispering that "things were going wrong at
      home with the Coates's&mdash;that the world was going down hill with the
      alderman."
    </p>
    <p>
      But a lady, who was quite a stranger, though she did me the honour to
      speak to me, explained that it was "no such thing&mdash;worth a plum
      still, if he be worth a farthing. 'Tis only that she was greatly put out
      of her way last week, and frightened, till well nigh beside herself, by
      them rioters that came and set fire to one of the Coates's, Mr. Peter's,
      warehouse. Now, though poor Mrs. Coates, you'd think, is so plump and
      stout to look at, she is as nervous!&mdash;you've no notion, sir!&mdash;shakes
      like an aspen leaf, if she but takes a cup of green tea&mdash;so I
      prescribe bohea. But there she's curtsying, and nodding, and kissing hands
      to you, sir, see!&mdash;and can tell you, no doubt, all about herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coates's deplorably placid countenance, tremulous muscles, and
      lamentable voice and manner, confirmed to me the truth of the assertion
      that she had been frightened nearly out of her senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why now, sir, after all," said she, "I begin to find what fools we were,
      when we made such a piece of work one election year, and said that no
      soldiers should come into the town, 'cause we were <i>free Britons</i>.
      Why, Lord 'a mercy! 'tis a great deal better <i>maxim</i> to sleep safe in
      our beds than to be <i>free Britons</i> and burnt to death [Footnote: Vide
      Mrs. Piozzi's Letters.]."

      Persons of higher pretensions to understanding and courage than poor Mrs.
      Coates, seemed at this time ready to adopt her maxim; and patriots feared
      that it might become the national sentiment. No sooner were order and
      tranquillity perfectly re-established in the city, than the public in
      general, and party politicians in particular, were intent upon the trials
      of the rioters, and more upon the question whether the military had
      suppressed the riots constitutionally or unconstitutionally. It was a
      question to be warmly debated in parliament; and this, after the manner in
      which great public and little private interests, in the chain of human
      events, are continually linked together, proved of important consequence
      to me and my love affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A call of the house brought my father to town, contrary to his will, and
      consequently in ill-humour. This ill-humour was increased by the
      perplexing situation in which he found himself, with his passions on one
      side of the question and his principles on the other: hating the papists,
      and loving the ministry. In his secret soul, my father cried with the
      rioters, "No papists!&mdash;no French!&mdash;no Jews!&mdash;no wooden
      shoes!" but a cry against government was abhorrent to his very nature. My
      conduct, with regard to the riot at Mr. Montenero's, and towards the
      rioters, by whom he had been falsely accused, my father heard spoken of
      with approbation in the political circles which he most reverenced; and he
      could not but be pleased, he confessed, to hear that his son had so
      properly conducted himself: but still it was all in defence of the Jews,
      and of the father of that Jewess whose very name was intolerable to his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Harrington, my boy, you've gained great credit, I find, by your
      conduct last Wednesday night. Very lucky, too, for your mother's friend,
      Lady de Brantefield, that you were where you were. But after all, sir,
      what the devil business had you there?&mdash;and again on Thursday
      morning!&mdash;I acknowledge that was a good hit you made, about the gun&mdash;but
      I wish it had been in the defence of some good Christian: what business
      has a Jew with a gun at all?&mdash;Government knows best, to be sure; but
      I split against them once before, three-and-twenty years ago, on the
      naturalization bill. What is this cry which the people set up?&mdash;'<i>No
      Jews!&mdash;no wooden shoes</i>!'&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;the dogs!&mdash;but
      they carried it too far, the rascals!&mdash;When it comes to throwing
      stones at gentlemen's carriages, and pulling down gentlemen's and
      noblemen's dwelling-houses, it's a mob and a riot, and the rioters deserve
      certainly to be hanged&mdash;and I'm heartily glad my son has come
      forward, Mrs. Harrington, and has taken a decided and distinguished part
      in bringing the offenders to justice. But, Harrington, pray tell me now,
      young gentleman, about that Jewess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I opened my lips, something in the turn of my physiognomy enraged
      my father to such a degree that all the blood in his body came into his
      face, and, starting up, he cried, "Don't answer me, sir&mdash;I ask no
      questions&mdash;I don't want to hear any thing about the matter! Only <i>if</i>&mdash;if,
      sir&mdash;if&mdash;that's all I have to say&mdash;if&mdash;by Jupiter
      Ammon&mdash;sir, I won't hear a word&mdash;a syllable! You only wish to
      explain&mdash;I won't have any explanation&mdash;I have business enough on
      my hands, without listening to a madman's nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      My father began to open his morning's packet of letters and newspapers.
      One letter, which had been directed to his house in the country, and which
      had followed him to town, seemed to, alarm him terribly. He put the letter
      into my mother's hand, cursed all the post-masters in England, who were
      none of them to blame for its not reaching him sooner, called for his hat
      and cane, said he must go instantly to the city, but "feared all was, too
      late, and that we were undone." With this comfortable assurance he left
      us. The letter was from a broker in Lombard-street, who did business for
      my father, and who wrote to let him know that, "in consequence of the
      destruction of a great brewery in the late riots, several mercantile
      houses had been injured. Alderman Coates had died suddenly of an apoplexy,
      it was said: his house had closed on Saturday; and it was feared that
      Baldwin's bank would not stand the run made on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in Baldwin's bank, as my mother informed me, my father had eight days
      before lodged 30,000, the purchase money of that estate which he had been
      obliged to sell to pay for his three elections. This sum was, in fact,
      every shilling of it due to creditors, who had become clamorous; and "if
      <i>this</i> be gone," said my mother, "we are lost indeed!&mdash;this
      house must go, and the carriages, and every thing; the Essex estate is all
      we shall have left, and live there as we can&mdash;very ill it must be, to
      us who have been used to affluence and luxury. Your father, who expects
      his table, and every individual article of his establishment, to be in the
      first style, as if by magic, without ever reflecting on the means, but
      just inviting people, and leaving it to me to entertain them properly&mdash;oh!
      I know how bitterly he would feel even retrenchment!&mdash;and this would
      be ruin; and every thing that vexes him of late brings on directly a fit
      of the gout&mdash;and then you know what his temper is! Heaven knows what
      I had to go through with my nerves, and my delicate health, during the
      last fit, which came on the very day after we left you, and lasted six
      weeks, and which he sets down to your account, Harrington, and to the
      account of your Jewess."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had too much feeling for my mother's present distress to increase her
      agitation by saying any thing on this tender subject. I let her accuse me
      as she pleased&mdash;and she very soon began to defend me. The accounts
      she had heard in various letters of the notice that had been taken of Miss
      Montenero by some of the leading persons in the fashionable world, the
      proposals that had been made to her, and especially the addresses of Lord
      Mowbray, which had been of sufficient publicity, had made, I found, a
      considerable alteration in my mother's judgment or feelings. She observed
      that it was a pity my father was so violently prejudiced and obstinate,
      for that, after all, it would not be an unprecedented marriage. My mother,
      after a pause, went on to say, that though she was not, she hoped, an
      interested person, and should scorn the idea of her son's being a
      fortune-hunter&mdash;and indeed I had given pretty sufficient proof that I
      was not of that description of suitors; yet, if the Jewess were really
      amiable, and as capable of generous attachment, it would be, my mother at
      last acknowledged, the best thing I could do, to secure an independent
      establishment with the wife of my choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just going to tell my mother of the conversation that I had had with
      Mr. Montenero, and of <i>the obstacle</i>, when her mind reverted to the
      Lombard-street letter, and to Baldwin's bank; and for a full hour we
      discussed the probability of Baldwin's standing or failing, though neither
      of us had any means of judging&mdash;of this, being perhaps the least
      anxious of the two, I became sensible the first. I finished, by stationing
      myself at the window to watch for my father's return, of which I promised
      to give my mother notice, if she would lie down quietly on the sofa, and
      try to compose her spirits; she had given orders to be denied to all
      visitors, but every knock at the door made her start, and "There's your
      father! There's Mr. Harrington!" was fifty times repeated before the hour
      when it was even possible that my father could have returned from the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the probable time came and passed, when it grew later and later
      without my father's appearing, our anxiety and impatience rose to the
      highest pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I gave my mother notice that I saw among the walkers at the end of
      the street which joined our square, an elderly gentleman with a cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there are so many elderly gentlemen with canes," said my mother,
      joining me at the window. "Is it Mr. Harrington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very like my father, ma'am. Now you can see him plainly picking his
      way over the crossing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is looking down," said my mother; "that is a very bad sign.&mdash;But
      is he not looking up now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ma'am; and now he is taking snuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taking snuff! is he? Then there is some hope," said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last forty yards of my father's walk, we each drew innumerable
      and often opposite conclusions, from his slightest gestures and motions,
      interpreting them all as favourable or unfavourable omens. In the course
      of five minutes my mother's <i>presentiments</i> varied fifty times. At
      length came his knock at the door. My mother grew pale&mdash;to her ear it
      said "all's lost;" to mine it sounded like "all's safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He stays to take off his great coat! a good sign; but he comes heavily up
      stairs." Our eyes were fixed on the door&mdash;he opened it, and advanced
      towards us without uttering one syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All's lost&mdash;and all's safe," said my father. "My fortune's safe,
      Mrs. Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What becomes of your presentiments, my dear mother?" said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven!" said my mother, "I was wrong for once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might thank Heaven for more than once, madam," said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then what did you mean by all's lost, Mr. Harrington; if all's safe,
      how can all be lost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My all, Mrs. Harrington, is not all fortune. There is such a thing as
      credit as well as fortune, Mrs. Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you have not lost your fortune, you have not lost your credit, I
      presume," said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a character as a gentleman, Mrs. Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A character for consistency, Mrs. Harrington, to preserve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a hard thing to preserve, no doubt," said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I wish you'd speak plain, for my nerves can't bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can tell you, Mrs. Harrington, your nerves have a great deal to
      bear yet. What will your nerves feel, madam&mdash;what will your
      enthusiasm say, sir&mdash;when I tell you, that I have lost my heart to&mdash;a
      Jewess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Berenice!" cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" cried my mother. "How came you to see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not for you to know yet; but first, young gentleman, you who are
      hanging on tenter-hooks, you must hang there a little longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as you please, my dear father," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Your dear father</i>!&mdash;ay, I'm very dear to you now, because you
      are in hopes, sir, I shall turn fool, and break my vow into the bargain;
      but I am not come to <i>that</i> yet, my good sir&mdash;I have some
      consistency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! never mind your consistency, for mercy's sake, Mr. Harrington," said
      my mother, "only tell us your story, for I really am dying to hear it, and
      I am so weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ring the bell for dinner," said my father, "for Mrs. Harrington's so
      weak, I'll keep my story till after dinner." My mother protested she was
      quite strong, and we both held my father fast, insisting&mdash;he being in
      such excellent humour and spirits that we might insist&mdash;insisting
      upon his telling his story before he should have any dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was I?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know best," said my mother; "you said you had lost your heart to a
      Jewess, and Harrington exclaimed <i>Berenice!</i> and that's all I've
      heard yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, let us leave Berenice for the present"&mdash;I groaned&mdash;"and
      go to her father, Mr. Montenero, and to a certain Mrs. Coates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Coates! did you see her too?" cried my mother: "you seem to have
      seen every body in the world this morning, Mr. Harrington. How happened it
      that you saw vulgar Mrs. Coates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless I shut my eyes, how can I avoid seeing vulgar people, madam? and
      how can I tell my story, Mrs. Harrington, if you interrupt me perpetually,
      to ask how I came to see every soul and body I mention?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will interrupt you no more," said my mother, submissively, for she was
      curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I placed an arm-chair for my father&mdash;in my whole life I never felt so
      dutiful or so impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now," said my father, taking his seat in the chair, "if you will
      promise not to interrupt me any more, I will tell you my story regularly.
      I went to Baldwin's bank: I found a great crowd, all pressing their
      demands&mdash;the clerks as busy as they could be, and all putting a good
      face upon the matter. The head-clerk I saw was vexed at the sight of me&mdash;he
      came out from behind his desk, and begged I would go up stairs to Mr.
      Baldwin, who wished to speak to me. I was shown up stairs to Mr. Baldwin,
      with whom I found a remarkably gentlemanlike foreign-looking man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir&mdash;yes, ma'am&mdash;Mr. Montenero: it is well you did not
      either of you interrupt me to tell me his name, for if you had, I would
      not have told you a word more. Well, Mr. Baldwin, evidently wishing me at
      the devil, came forward to receive me, and, in great perplexity, said he
      would be at my command; he would settle my business immediately; but must
      beg my pardon for five minutes, while he settled with this gentleman, <i>Mr.
      Montenero</i>. On hearing the name, I am sure my look would have said
      plain enough to any man alive but Baldwin, that I did not choose to be
      introduced; but Baldwin has no breeding: so it was <i>Mr. Montenero, Mr.
      Harrington&mdash;Mr. Harrington, Mr. Montenero</i>. I bowed, and wished
      the <i>Jew</i> in the Red Sea, and Baldwin along with him. I then took up
      a newspaper and retreated to the window, begging that I might not be any
      interruption. The cursed paper was four days old, so I put it down; and as
      I stood looking at nothing out of the window, I heard Baldwin going on
      with your Jew. They had a load of papers on the table, which Baldwin kept
      shuffling, as he talked about the losses the house had sustained by the
      sudden death of Alderman Coates, and the sad bankruptcy of the executors.
      Baldwin seasoned high with compliments to the Jew upon his known
      liberality and generosity, and was trying to get him to enter into some
      security, which the Jew refused, saying that what he gave he gave
      willingly, but he would not enter into security: he added, that the
      alderman and his family had been unjustifiably extravagant; but on
      condition that all was given up fairly to the creditors, and a new course
      entered upon, he and his daughter would take care that the widow should be
      provided for properly. As principal creditor, Mr. Baldwin would, by this
      means, be first satisfied. I could not help thinking that all the Jew said
      was fair enough, and firm too; but when he had said and done, I wondered
      that he did not go away. He and Baldwin came to the window to which I had
      retreated, and Baldwin, like a city bear as he is, got in his awkward way
      between us, and seizing one button of my coat and one of Mr. Montenero's,
      held us there face to face, while he went on talking of my demand on the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You see, Mr. Harrington,' said he, 'how we are circumstanced. The
      property of the firm is able to answer all fair demands in due course. But
      here's a set and a run made against us, and no house could stand without
      the assistance, that is, the forbearance of friends&mdash;that's what we
      must look to. Some of our friends, in particular Mr. Montenero, have been
      very friendly indeed&mdash;very handsome and liberal&mdash;and we have
      nothing to say; we cannot, in reason, expect him to do more for the
      Coates's or for us.' And then came accounts of the executors, &amp;c., in
      his banking jargon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce was all this to me, you know? and how awkward I felt, held
      by the button there, to rejudge Mr. Montenero's acts! I had nothing for it
      but my snuff-box. But Baldwin's a mere clerk&mdash;cannot guess at the
      feelings of a gentleman. Mr. Montenero, I observed, looked down upon
      Baldwin all the time with so much the air of a high-bred gentleman, that I
      began to think he could not be the Jew&mdash;Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baldwin, still thinking only of holding him up as an example to me, went
      on, saying, 'Mr. Montenero, who is a foreigner, and a stranger to the
      house, has done so and so, and we trust our old friends will do as much&mdash;Mr.
      Harrington in particular. There's our books on the table, open to Mr.
      Harrington&mdash;he will see we shall be provided on the fifteenth
      instant; but, in short, if Mr. Harrington draws his 30,000 to-day, he
      drives us to pay in sixpences&mdash;so there's the case.' In short, it
      came to this: if I drew, I certainly ruined them; if I did not draw, I ran
      a great hazard of being ruined myself. No, Baldwin would not have it that
      way&mdash;so when he had stated it after his own fashion, and put it into
      and out of his banker's jargon, it came out to be, that if I drew directly
      I was certain to lose the whole; and if I did not draw, I should have a
      good chance of losing a great part. I pulled my button away from the
      fellow, and without listening to any more of his jabbering, for I saw he
      was only speaking <i>against time</i>, and all on his own side of the
      question, I turned to look at the books, of which I knew I never should
      make head or tail, being no auditor of accounts, but a plain country
      gentleman. While I was turning over their confounded day-books and ledgers
      in despair, your Jew, Harrington, came up to me, and with such a manner as
      I did not conceive a Jew could have&mdash;but he is a Spanish Jew&mdash;that
      makes all the difference, I suppose&mdash;'Mr. Harrington,' said he,
      'though I am a stranger to you, permit me to offer my services in this
      business&mdash;I have some right to do so, as I have accepted of services,
      and am under real obligations to Mr. Harrington, your son, a young
      gentleman for whom I feel the highest attachment as well as gratitude, but
      of whom I will now say only, that he has been one of the chief means of
      saving my life and my character. His father cannot, therefore, I think,
      refuse to let me show at least some sense of the obligations I have
      willingly received. My collection of Spanish pictures, which, without your
      son's exertions, I could not have saved on the night of the riot, has been
      estimated by your best English connoisseurs at 60,000. Three English
      noblemen are at this moment ready to pay down 30,000 for a few of these
      pictures: this will secure Mr. Harrington's demand on this house. If you,
      Mr. Baldwin, pay him, before three hours are over the money shall be with
      you. It is no sacrifice of my taste or of my pictures,' continued your
      noble Jew, in answer to my scruples: 'I lodge them with three different
      bankers only for security for the money. If Mr. Baldwin stands the storm,
      we are all as we were&mdash;my pictures into the bargain. If the worst
      happen, I lose only a few instead of all my collection.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was very generous&mdash;quite noble, but you know I am an obstinate
      old fellow. I had still the Jewess, the daughter, running in my head, and
      I thought, perhaps, I was to be asked for my <i>consent</i>, you know,
      Harrington, or some sly underplot of that kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Montenero has a quick eye&mdash;I perceived that he saw into my
      thoughts; but we could not speak to our purpose before Baldwin, and
      Baldwin would never think of stirring, if one was dying to get him out of
      the room. Luckily, however, he was called away by one of the clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Mr. Montenero, who speaks more to the point than any man I ever
      heard, spoke directly of your love for his daughter, and said he
      understood that it would not be a match that I should approve. I pleaded
      my principles and religious difficulties:&mdash;he replied, 'We need not
      enter into that, for the present business I must consider as totally
      independent of any view to future connexion:'&mdash;if his daughter was
      going to be married to-morrow to another man, he should do exactly the
      same as he now proposed to do. He did not lessen her fortune:&mdash;he
      should say nothing of what her sense of gratitude was and ought to be&mdash;she
      had nothing to do with the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I found that my <i>Jupiter Amman</i> was in no danger, and that the
      love affair was to be kept clear out of the question, I was delighted with
      your generous Jew, Harrington, and I frankly accepted his offer. Baldwin
      came in again, was quite happy when he heard how it was settled, gave me
      three drafts at thirty-one days for my money on the bankers Mr. Montenero
      named: here I have them safe in my pocket. Mr. Montenero then said, he
      would go immediately and perform his part of the business; and, as he left
      the room, he begged Mr. Baldwin to tell his daughter that he would call
      for her in an hour.
    </p>

      "I now, for the first time, understood that the daughter was in the house;
      and I certainly felt a curiosity to see her. Baldwin told me she was
      settling some business, signing some papers in favour of poor Mrs. Coates,
      the alderman's widow. He added, that the Jewess was a charming creature,
      and as generous as her father:&mdash;he told all she had done for this
      widow and her children, on account of some kindness her mother had
      received in early life from the Coates's family; and then there was a
      history of some other family of Manessas&mdash;I never heard Baldwin
      eloquent but this day, in speaking of your Jewess:&mdash;Harrington, I
      believe he is in love with her himself. I said I should like to see her,
      if it could be managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing easier, if I would partake of a cold collation just serving in
      the next room for the friends of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the nearer a man is to being ruined, the better he must
      entertain his friends. I walked into the next room, when collation time
      came, and I saw Miss Montenero. Though I had given him a broad hint&mdash;but
      the fellow understands nothing but his IOU's&mdash;he fell to introducing
      of course: she is a most interesting-looking creature, I acknowledge, my
      boy, if&mdash;she were not a Jewess. I thought she would have sunk into
      the earth when she heard my name. I could not eat one morsel of the man's
      collation&mdash;so&mdash;Ring for dinner, and let us say no more about the
      matter at present: there is my oath against it, you know&mdash;there is an
      end of the matter&mdash;don't let me hear a word from you, Harrington&mdash;I
      am tired to death, quite exhausted, body and mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      I refrained most dutifully, and most prudently, from saying one word more
      on the subject, till my father, after dinner, and after being refreshed by
      a sound and long-protracted sleep, began again to speak of Mr. and Miss
      Montenero. This was the first time he omitted to call them the Jew and
      Jewess. He condescended to say repeatedly, and with many oaths, that they
      both deserved to be Christians&mdash;that if there was any chance of the
      girl's conversion, even <i>he</i> would overlook the father's being a Jew,
      as he was such a noble fellow. Love could do wonders&mdash;as my father
      knew when he was a young man&mdash;perhaps I might bring about her
      conversion, and then all would be smooth and right, and no oath against
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked my father for the kind concessions he now appeared willing to
      make for my happiness, and from step to step, at each step repeating that
      he did not want to hear a syllable about the matter, he made me tell him
      every thing that had passed. Mowbray's rivalship and treachery excited his
      indignation in the highest degree: he was heartily glad that fellow was
      refused&mdash;he liked the girl for refusing him&mdash;some spirit&mdash;he
      liked spirit&mdash;and he should be glad that his son carried away the
      prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted himself to tell me some of the feats of gallantry of his
      younger days, and of the manner in which he had at last carried off my
      mother from a rascal of a rival&mdash;a Lord Mowbray of those times.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my father had got to this point, my mother ventured to ask whether I
      had ever gone so far as to propose, actually to <i>propose</i>, for Miss
      Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both father and mother turned about, and asked, "What answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated, as nearly as I could, Mr. Montenero's words&mdash;and I
      produced his note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both excited surprise and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can this obstacle&mdash;this mysterious obstacle be?" said my
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An obstacle on their side!" exclaimed my father: "is that possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now, at least, the pleasure of enjoying their sympathy: and of
      hearing them go over all the conjectures by which I had been bewildered. I
      observed that the less chance there appeared to be of the match, the more
      my father and mother inclined towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least," said my mother, "I hope we shall know what the objection is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very extraordinary, after all, that it should be on their side,"
      repeated my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother's imagination, and my father's pride, were both strongly
      excited; and I let them work without interruption.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The time appointed for Mr. Montenero's final decision approached. In a few
      days my fate was to be decided. The vessel that was to sail for America
      was continually before my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more difficult to me to endure the suspense of these few days than
      all the rest. My mother's sympathy, and the strong interest which had been
      excited on the subject in my father's mind, were at first highly
      agreeable; but there was so much more of curiosity and of pride in their
      feelings than in mine, that at last it became irksome to me to hear their
      conjectures and reflections. I did not like to answer any questions&mdash;I
      could not bear to speak of Berenice, or even of Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took refuge in silence&mdash;my mother reproached me for my silence. I
      talked on fast of any thing but that which interested me most.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother became extremely alarmed for my health, and I believe with more
      reason than usual; for I could scarcely either eat, drink, or sleep, and
      was certainly very feverish; but still I walked about, and to escape from
      the constraint to which I put myself in her company, to avoid giving her
      pain&mdash;to relieve myself from her hourly fond inquiries&mdash;from the
      effort of talking, when I wished to be silent&mdash;of appearing well, and
      in spirits, when I was ill, and when my heart was dying within me, I
      escaped from her presence as much as possible. To feed upon my thoughts in
      solitude, I either shut myself up in my room, or walked all day in those
      streets where I was not likely to meet with any one who knew me, or whom I
      knew; and there I was at least safe from all notice, and secure from all
      sympathy: I am sure I experienced at this time the truth of what some one
      has quaintly but justly asserted, that an individual can never feel more
      completely alone than in the midst of a crowded metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when I was returning homewards through the city, fatigued, but
      still prolonging my walk, that I might not be at home too early for
      dinner, I was met and stopped by Jacob: I had not thought of him lately,
      and when I looked up in his face, I was surprised by an appearance of
      great perturbation. He begged pardon for stopping me, but he had been to
      my house&mdash;he had been all over the town searching for me, to consult
      me about a sad affair, in which he was unfortunately concerned. We were
      not far from Manessa's, the jeweller's shop; I went in there with Jacob,
      as he wished, he said, that I should hear Mr. Manessa's evidence on the
      business, as well as his own. The affair was this: Lady de Brantefield
      had, some time ago, brought to Mr. Manessa's some very fine antique
      jewels, to be re-set for her daughter, Lady Anne Mowbray. One day,
      immediately after the riots, both the ladies called at Mr. Manessa's, to
      inquire if the jewels were ready. They were finished; the new setting was
      approved: but Lady de Brantefield having suffered great losses by the
      destruction of her house and furniture in the riots, and her son, Lord
      Mowbray, being also in great pecuniary difficulties, it was suggested by
      Lady Anne Mowbray, that her mother would be glad if Mr. Manessa could
      dispose of some of the jewels, without letting it be known to whom they
      had belonged. Mr. Manessa, willing to oblige, promised secresy, and
      offered immediately to purchase the jewels himself; in consequence, the
      jewels were all spread out upon a little table in the back parlour&mdash;no
      one present but Jacob, Mr. Manessa, and the two ladies. A great deal of
      conversation passed, and the ladies were a long time settling what
      trinkets they would part with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very difficult to accommodate at once the personal vanity of the
      daughter, the family pride of the mother, and their pecuniary
      difficulties. There occurred, in particular, a question about a topaz
      ring, of considerable value, but of antique setting, which Lady Anne
      Mowbray wished her mother to part with, instead of some more fashionable
      diamond ornament that Lady Anne wanted to keep for herself. Lady de
      Brantefield had, however, resisted all her daughter's importunities&mdash;had
      talked a vast deal about the ring&mdash;told that it had been Sir
      Josseline de Mowbray's&mdash;that it had come into his possession by ducal
      and princely descent&mdash;that it was one of four rings, which had been
      originally a present from Pope Innocent to King John, of which rings there
      was a full description in some old chronicle [Footnote: Rymer's Foedera.],
      and in Mr. Hume's History of England, to which her ladyship referred Mr.
      Manessa: his curiosity [Footnote: For the satisfaction of any readers who
      may have more curiosity upon the subject than Mr. Manessa had, but yet who
      would not willingly rise from their seats to gratify their curiosity, the
      passage is here given <i>gratis</i>. "Innocent wrote John a mollifying
      letter, and sent him four golden rings, set with precious stones; and
      endeavoured to enhance the value of the present, by informing him of the
      many mysteries which were implied by it. He begged him to consider,
      seriously, the <i>form</i> of the rings, their <i>number</i>, their <i>matter</i>,
      and their <i>colour</i>. Their form, he said, being round, shadowed out
      eternity, which has neither beginning nor end. Their number, four, being a
      square, denoted steadiness of mind, not to be subverted either by
      adversity or prosperity, fixed for ever on the four cardinal virtues.
      Gold, which is the matter, signified wisdom. The blue of the sapphire,
      faith. The verdure of the emerald, hope. The redness of the ruby, charity.
      And splendour of the topaz, good works." "By these conceits," continued
      the historian, "Innocent endeavoured to repay John for one of the most
      important prerogatives of the crown."], however, was perfectly satisfied
      upon the subject, and he was, with all due deference, willing to take the
      whole upon her ladyship's word, without presuming to verify her
      authorities. While she spoke, she took the ring from her finger, and put
      it into Jacob's hand, desiring to know if he could make it fit her finger
      better, as it was rather too large. Jacob told her it could be easily
      lessened, if her ladyship would leave it for an hour or two with him. But
      her ladyship said she could not let Sir Josseline's ring out of her own
      sight, it was of such inestimable value. The troublesome affair of
      satisfying both the vain daughter and the proud mother being accomplished&mdash;the
      last bows were made at the door&mdash;the carriage drove away, and Manessa
      and Jacob thanked Heaven that they had done with these <i>difficult</i>
      customers. Two hours had scarcely elapsed before a footman came from Lady
      de Brantefield with the following note:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady de Brantefield informs Mr. Manessa that she is in the greatest
      anxiety&mdash;not finding Sir Josseline de Mowbray's ring on her finger,
      upon her return home. Her ladyship now recollects having left it in the
      hands of one of Mr. Manessa's shopmen, a young man she believes of the
      name of Jacob, the only person except Mr. Manessa, who was in the little
      parlour, while her ladyship and Lady Anne Mowbray were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady de Brantefield requests that Mr. Manessa will bring the ring <i>himself</i>
      to Lady Warbeck's, Hanover-square, where Lady de Brantefield is at
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady de Brantefield desires Mr. M. will make <i>no delay</i>, as her
      ladyship must remain in indescribable anxiety till Sir Josseline's ring
      shall be restored. Her ladyship could not answer for such a loss to her
      family and posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Hanover-square, Tuesday.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob was perfectly certain that her ladyship had not left the ring with
      him; nevertheless he made diligent search for it, and afterwards
      accompanied Mr. Manessa to Lady Warbeck's, to assure Lady de Brantefield
      that the ring was not in their house. He endeavoured to bring to her
      recollection her having put it on her finger just before she got into the
      carriage; but this her ladyship would not admit. Lady Anne supported her
      mother's assertions; and Lady de Brantefield ended by being haughtily
      angry, declaring she would not be contradicted by a shopman, and that she
      was positive the ring had never been returned to her. Within
      eight-and-forty hours the story was told by Lady de Brantefield and her
      friends at every card-table at the polite end of the town, and it was
      spread by Lady Anne through the park and the ball-rooms; and the
      ladies'-maids had repeated it, with all manner of exaggerations, through
      their inferior but not less extensive circles. The consequence was, that
      the character of Mr. Manessa's house was hurt, and Jacob, who was the
      person accused as the cause of it, was very unhappy. The confidence Mr.
      Manessa had in him, and the kindness he showed him, increased his regret.
      Lady de Brantefield had, in a high tone, threatened a prosecution for the
      value of her <i>inestimable</i> ring. This was what both Jacob and Mr.
      Manessa would have desired&mdash;a public trial, they knew, would bring
      the truth to light; but her ladyship was probably discouraged by her legal
      advisers from a prosecution, so that Mr. Manessa and Jacob were still left
      to suffer by the injustice of private whisperings. Jacob offered to
      replace, as far as he could, the value of this ring; but in Lady de
      Brantefield's opinion nothing could compensate for its loss. Poor Jacob
      was in despair. Before I heard this story, I thought that nothing could
      have forced my attention from my own affairs; but I could not be so
      selfish as to desert or neglect Jacob in his distress. I went with my
      mother this evening to see Lady de Brantefield; her ladyship was still at
      her relation's, Lady Warbeck's house, where she had apartments to herself,
      in which she could receive what company she pleased. There was to be a
      ball in the house this evening, but Lady de Brantefield never mixed in
      what she called <i>idle gaieties</i>; she abhorred a bustle, as it
      infringed upon her personal dignity, and did not agree with her internal
      persuasion that she was, or ought to be, the first object in all company.
      We found her ladyship in her own retired apartment; her eyes were weak,
      and the room had so little light in it, that when we first went in, I
      could scarcely distinguish any object: I saw, however, a young woman, who
      had been reading to her ladyship, rise as we entered, put down her book,
      and prepare to retire. My mother stopped her as she was passing, and
      turning to me, said, that this was a young person, she was sure, I should
      be glad to see, the daughter of an old friend of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked, and saw a face which awakened the most painful associations of
      my childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not I perceive any likeness?" my mother continued. "But it was so
      many years since I had seen poor Fowler, and I was so very young a child,
      no wonder I should not in the least recollect."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had some recollection&mdash;if I was not mistaken&mdash;I stammered&mdash;I
      stopped. In fact, I recollected too well to be able to pay the expected
      compliment. However, after I had got over the first involuntary shudder, I
      tried to say something to relieve the embarrassment which I fancied the
      girl must feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, in a mincing, waiting-gentlewoman's manner, and with a certain
      unnatural softness of voice, which again brought all the mother to my
      mind, assured me that if I'd forgot her mother, she had not forgot me; for
      that she'd often and often heard her mother talk of me, and she was
      morally confident her mother had never loved any child so doatingly,
      except, to be sure, her own present lady's, Lady Anne Mowbray. Her mother
      had often and often regretted she could never get a sight or sentence of
      me since I grew up to be a great gentleman, she always having been
      stationary down at my lady's, in Surrey, at the Priory&mdash;housekeeper&mdash;and
      I never there; but if I'd have the condescension to wish to gratify her
      mother, as it would be the greatest gratification in life&mdash;if Lady de
      Brantefield&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Presently, perhaps&mdash;when I ring," said Lady de Brantefield, "and
      you, Nancy Fowler, may come back yourself with my treble ruffles: Mrs.
      Harrington, I know, will have the goodness to permit. I keep her as much
      under my own eye, and suffer her to be as much even in the room with me,
      as possible," added Lady de Brantefield, as Nancy left the room; "for she
      is a young person quite out of the common line, and her mother i&mdash;but
      you first recommended her to me, Mrs. Harrington, I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The most faithful creature!</i>" said my mother, in the very tone I
      had heard it pronounced twenty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was carried back so far, so forcibly, and so suddenly, that it was some
      time before I could recover myself sufficiently to recollect what was the
      order of the day; but no matter&mdash;my mother passed on quite easily to
      the jewels, and my silence was convenient, and had an air of perfect
      deference for Lady de Brantefield's long story of Sir Josseline's ring,
      now told over, I believe, for the ninety-ninth time this season. She ended
      where she began, with the conviction that, if the secretary of state
      would, as he ought, on such an occasion, grant a general search-warrant,
      as she was informed had been done for papers, and things of much less
      value, her ring would be found in <i>that</i> Jacob's possession&mdash;<i>that</i>
      Jacob, of whom she had a very bad opinion!
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the matter up as quietly as was in my nature, and did not begin
      with a panegyric on my friend Jacob, but simply asked, what reason her
      ladyship had for her very bad opinion of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Too good reason, her ladyship emphatically said: she had heard her son,
      Lord Mowbray, express a <i>very</i> bad opinion of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mowbray had known this Jacob, she believed, when a boy, and
      afterwards when a man at Gibraltar, and had always thought ill of him.
      Lord Mowbray had said, that Jacob was avaricious and revengeful; as you
      know Jews always are, added her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered she had trusted her jewels, then, in such hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, she owned, she had for once been wrong&mdash;overruled by others&mdash;by
      her daughter, Lady Anne, who said the jewels could be more fashionably set
      at Manessa's than any where else.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never acted against her own judgment in her life, without
      repenting of it. Another circumstance, Lady de Brantefield said,
      prepossessed her, she owned, against this Jacob; he was from the very
      dregs of the people; the son absolutely of an old clothes-man, she had
      been informed. What could be expected from such a person, when temptation
      came in his way? and could we trust to any thing such a low sort of person
      would say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne Mowbray, before I had time to answer, entered dressed for the
      ball, with her jewels in full blaze, and for some time there was a
      suspension of all hope of coming to any thing like common sense. When her
      mother appealed to her about Jacob, Lady Anne protested she took a horrid
      dislike to his face the moment she saw him; she thought he had a shocking
      Jewish sort of countenance, and she was positive he would swear falsely,
      because he was ready to swear that her mamma had the ring on her finger
      when she got into the carriage&mdash;now Lady Anne was clear she had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has your ladyship," I asked, "any particular reason for remembering this
      fact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! several very particular reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is sometimes wisdom in listening to a fool's reasons; for ten to one
      that the reasons will prove the contrary to what they are brought to
      support, or will at least bring out some fact, the distant bearing of
      which on the point of question the fool does not perceive. But when two
      fools pour out their reasons at once, it is difficult to profit even by
      their folly. The mother's authority at last obtaining precedency, I heard
      Lady de Brantefield's cause of belief, first: her ladyship declared that
      she never wore Sir Josseline's ring without putting on after it a <i>guard
      ring</i>, a ring which, being tighter than Sir Josseline's, kept it safe
      on her finger. She remembered drawing off the guard ring when she took off
      Sir Josseline's, and put that into Jacob's hands; her ladyship said it was
      clear to her mind that she could not have put on Sir Josseline's again,
      because here was the guard ring on her <i>wrong</i> finger&mdash;a finger
      on which she never in her life wore it when she wore Sir Josseline's, for
      Sir Josseline's was so loose, it would drop off, unless she had the guard
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But was not it possible," I asked, "that your ladyship might this once
      have put on Sir Josseline's ring without recollecting the guard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, absolutely impossible: if Jacob and all the Jews upon earth swore it
      (who, by-the-bye, would swear any thing), she could not be convinced
      against her reason&mdash;she knew her own habits&mdash;her private reasons
      to her were unanswerable.

    <p>
      Lady Anne's private reasons to her were equally unanswerable; but they
      were so confused, and delivered with so much volubility, as to be
      absolutely unintelligible. All I could gather was, that Fowler and her
      daughter Nancy were in the room when Lady Anne and her mother first missed
      the ring&mdash;that when her mother drew off her glove, and exclaimed,
      "Bless me, Sir Josseline's not here!" Lady Anne ran up to the
      dressing-table, at which her mother was standing, to try to find the ring,
      thinking that her mother might have dropped it in drawing off her glove;
      "but it certainly was not drawn off with the glove."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But might not it be left in the glove?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear, no: I shook the glove myself, and Fowler turned every finger
      inside out, and Nancy moved every individual box upon the dressing-table.
      We were all in such a fuss, because you know mamma's so particular about
      Sir Josseline; and to tell you the truth, I was uncommonly anxious,
      because I knew if mamma was vexed and lost the ring, she would not give me
      a certain diamond cross, that makes me so particularly remember every
      circumstance&mdash;and I was in such a flurry, that I know I threw down a
      bottle of aether that was on mamma's toilette, on her muff&mdash;and it
      had such a horrid smell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The muff! I asked if the muff, as well as the glove, had been searched
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La! to be sure&mdash;I suppose so&mdash;of course it was shaken, as every
      thing else in the room was, a hundred times over: the toilette and mamma's
      petticoats even, and cloak, and gloves, as I told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but the muff, did your ladyship examine it yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I examine it? I don't recollect. No, indeed, after the aether, how
      could I touch it? you know: but of course it was shaken, it was examined,
      I am sure; but really I know nothing about it&mdash;but this, that it
      could not possibly be in it, the ring, I mean, because mamma had her glove
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      I requested permission to see the muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mamma was forced to give it away because of the horrid smell&mdash;she
      bid Fowler take it out of the room that minute, and never let it come near
      her again; but if you want to see it, ring for Fowler: you can examine it
      as much as you please; depend upon it the ring's no more there than I am&mdash;send
      for Fowler and Nancy, and they can tell you how we shook every thing to no
      purpose. The ring's gone, and so am I, for Colonel Topham's waiting, and I
      must lead off." And away her ladyship tripped, flirting her perfumed fan
      as she went. Persisting in my wish to see the muff, Lady de Brantefield
      desired me to ring for Fowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship wondered, she said, how I could, after the reasons she had
      given me for her being morally certain that she had left the ring with
      Jacob, and after Lady Anne had justly remarked that the ring could not get
      through her glove, entertain a hope of finding it in such a ridiculous
      place as a muff. But since I was so possessed with this idea, the muff
      should be produced&mdash;there was nothing like ocular demonstration in
      these cases, except internal conviction: "Did you ring, Mr. Harrington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Nancy with the treble ruffles in her hand now appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis your mother, child, I want," said Lady de Brantefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lady, she is only just finished assisting to lay out the ball
      supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want her&mdash;directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, my lady, directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And bid her bring&mdash;" A whisper from me to my mother, and from my
      mother to her ladyship, failed of effect: after turning half round, as if
      to ask me what I said&mdash;a look which did not pass unnoticed by Miss
      Nancy&mdash;her ladyship finished her sentence&mdash;"And tell Fowler I
      desire she will bring me the muff that I gave her last week&mdash;the day
      I lost my ring."
    </p>
    <p>
      This message would immediately put Fowler upon her guard, and I was at
      first sorry that it had been so worded; but I recollected having heard an
      eminent judge, a man of great abilities and experience, say, that if he
      were called upon to form a judgment of any character, or to discover the
      truth in any case, he would rather that the persons whom he was to examine
      were previously put on their guard, than that they were not; for that he
      should know, by what they guarded, of what they were afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fowler appeared&mdash;twenty years had so changed her face and figure,
      that the sight of her did not immediately shock me as I feared it would.
      The daughter, who, I suppose, more nearly resembled what her mother had
      been at the time I had known her, was, of the two, the most disagreeable
      to my sight and feelings. Fowler's voice was altered by the loss of a
      tooth, and it was even by this change less odious to my ear. The
      daughter's voice I could scarcely endure. I was somewhat relieved from the
      fear of being prejudiced against Fowler by the perception of this change
      in her; and while she was paying me her compliments, I endeavoured to
      fortify the resolution I had made to judge of her with perfect
      impartiality. Her delight at seeing me, however, I could not believe to be
      sincere; and the reiterated repetition of her sorrow for her never having
      been able to get a sight of me before, I thought ill-judged: but no
      matter; many people in her station make these sort of unmeaning speeches.
      If I had suffered my imagination to act, I should have fancied that under
      a sort of prepared composure there was constraint and alarm in her look as
      she spoke to me. I thought she trembled; but I resolved not to be
      prejudiced&mdash;and this I repeated to myself many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Fowler, but the muff," said Lady de Brantefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The muff&mdash;oh! dear, my lady, I'm so sorry I can't have it for you&mdash;it's
      not in the house nowhere&mdash;I parted with it out of hand directly upon
      your saying, my lady, that you desired it might never be suffered to come
      nigh your ladyship again. Then, says I to myself, since my lady can't
      abide the smell, I can't never wear it, which it would have been my pride
      to do; so I thought I could never get it fast enough out of the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I made a present of it, my lady, to poor Mrs. Baxter, John Dutton's
      sister, my lady, who was always so much attached to the family, and would
      have a regard for even the smallest relic, vestige, or vestment, I knew,
      above all things in nature, poor old soul!&mdash;she has, what with the
      rheumatic pains, and one thing or another, lost the use of her right arm,
      so it was particularly agreeable and appropriate&mdash;and she kissed the
      muff&mdash;oh! my lady, I'm sure I only wish your ladyship could have
      witnessed the poor soul's veneration."
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to a question which made my mother ask about the "poor soul," I
      further learned that Mrs. Baxter was wife to a pawnbroker in
      Swallow-street. Fowler added, "If my lady wished any way for the muff, I
      can get it to-morrow morning by breakfast, or by the time <i>you's up</i>,
      my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, very well, that will do, I suppose, will it not, Mr.
      Harrington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed, and said not a word more&mdash;Fowler, I saw, was glad to get rid
      of the subject, and to go on to the treble ruffles, on which while she and
      my mother and Lady de Brantefield were descanting, I made my exit, and
      went to the ball-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Lady Anne Mowbray&mdash;talked nonsense to her ladyship for a
      quarter of an hour&mdash;and at last, <i> propos </i>to her perfumed fan,
      I brought in the old muff with the horrid smell, on purpose to obtain a
      full description of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told me that it was a gray fox-skin, lined with scarlet; that it had
      great pompadour-coloured knots at each end, and that it was altogether
      hideous. Lady Anne declared that she was heartily glad it would never
      shock her eyes more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now just nine o'clock; people then kept better hours than they do
      at present; I was afraid that all the shops would be shut; but I
      recollected that pawnbrokers' shops were usually kept open late. I lost no
      time in pursuing my object.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a hackney coach, bribed the coachman to drive very fast to Mr.
      Manessa&mdash;found Manessa and Jacob going to bed sleepy&mdash;but at
      sight of me Jacob was alert in an instant, and joyfully ready to go with
      me immediately to Baxter, the pawnbroker's.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made Jacob furnish me with an old surtout and slouched hat, desiring to
      look as shabby as possible, that the pawnbroker might take me for one of
      his usual nightly customers, and might not be alarmed at the sight of a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't do yet, Mr. Harrington," said Jacob, when I had equipped
      myself in the old hat and coat. "Mr. Baxter will see the look of a
      gentleman through all that. It is not the shabby coat that will make the
      gentleman look shabby, no more than the fine coat can ever make <i>the
      shabby</i> look like the gentleman. The pawnbroker, who is used to observe
      and find out all manner of people, will know that as well as I&mdash;but
      now you shall see how well at one stroke I will disguise the gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob then twisted a dirty silk handkerchief round my throat, and this did
      the business so completely, that I defied the pawnbroker and all his
      penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove as fast as we could to Swallow-street&mdash;dismissed our hackney
      coach, and walked up to the pawnbroker's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light in the shop!&mdash;all alive!&mdash;and business going on. The shop
      was so full of people, that we stood for some minutes unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had leisure to look about us, as we had previously agreed to do, for
      Lady De Brantefield's muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a suspicion that, notwithstanding the veneration with which it had
      been said to be treated, it might have come to the common lot of cast
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob at one side, and I at the other, took a careful survey of the
      multifarious contents of the shop; of all that hung from the ceiling; and
      all that was piled on the shelves; and all that lay huddled in corners, or
      crammed into dark recesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the darkest and most ignominious of these, beneath a heap of
      sailors' old jackets and trowsers, I espied a knot of pompadour riband. I
      hooked it out a little with the stick I had in my hand; but Jacob stopped
      me, and called to the shopboy, who now had his eye upon us, and with him
      we began to bargain hard for some of the old clothes that lay upon the
      muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopboy lifted them up to display their merits, by the dimness of the
      candle-light, and, as he raised them up, there appeared beneath the gray
      fox-skin with its scarlet lining and pompadour knots, the Lady de
      Brantefield's much venerated muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could scarcely refrain from seizing upon it that moment, but Jacob again
      restrained me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on talking about the sailors' jackets, for which we had been in
      treaty; and he insisted upon having the old muff into the bargain. It
      actually was at last thrown in as a makeweight. Had she been witness to
      this bargain, I believe Lady De Brantefield would have dropped down in a
      swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment I got possession of it, I turned it inside out.&mdash;There
      were several small rents in the lining&mdash;but one in particular had
      obviously been cut open with scissars. The shopboy, who thought I was
      pointing out the rents to disparage my purchase, assured me that any
      woman, clever at her needle, would with half-a-dozen stitches sew all up,
      and make the muff as good again as new. Jacob desired the boy to show him
      some old seals, rings, and trinkets, fit for a pedlar to carry into the
      country; Jacob was, for this purpose, sent to the most respectable place
      at the counter, and promoted to the honour of dealing face to face with
      Mr. Baxter himself:&mdash;drawers, which had before been invisible, were
      now produced; and I stood by while Jacob looked over all the new and old
      trinkets. I was much surprised by the richness and value of various
      brooches, picture settings, watches, and rings, which had come to this
      fate: at last, in a drawer with many valuables, which Mr. Baxter told us
      that some great man's mistress had, last week, been obliged to leave with
      him, Jacob and I, at the same moment, saw "<i>the splendour of the topaz</i>"&mdash;Lady
      de Brantefield's inestimable ring! I must do myself the justice to say
      that I behaved incomparably well&mdash;did not make a single exclamation,
      though I was sure it was the identical ring, the moment I caught a glimpse
      of the topaz&mdash;and though a glance from Jacob convinced me I was
      right. I said I could wait no longer, but would call again for him in half
      an hour's time. This was what we had agreed upon beforehand should be the
      signal for my summoning a Bow-street officer, whom Mr. Manessa had in
      readiness. Jacob identified and swore to the property&mdash;Mr. Baxter was
      seized. He protested he did not know the ring was <i>stolen goods</i>&mdash;he
      could not recollect who had sold it to him; but when we mentioned Fowler's
      name, he grew pale, was disconcerted, and not knowing how much or how
      little we knew, decided at once to get out of the scrape himself by giving
      her up, and turning evidence against her. He stated that she had found it
      in the old muff, but that he never knew That this muff had belonged to
      Lady de Brantefield. Mrs. Fowler had assured Him that it had been left to
      her along with the wardrobe of a lady with Whom she had formerly lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Baxter had told all the lies he chose to invent, and confessed
      as much of the truth as he thought would serve his purpose, his deposition
      was taken and sworn to. This was all that could then be done, as it was
      near twelve o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jacob's joy at having his innocence proved, and at being relieved
      from the fear of injuring the credit of his master's house, raised his
      spirits higher than I ever saw them in my life before. But still his joy
      and gratitude were more shown by looks than words. He thanked me once, and
      but once, warmly and strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Mr. Harrington," said he, "from the time you were <i>Master</i>
      Harrington at school, you were my best friend&mdash;always my friend in
      most need&mdash;I trusted in you, and still I hoped!&mdash;hoped that the
      truth would stand, and the lie fall. See at last our Hebrew proverb right&mdash;'<i>A
      lie has no feet.</i>'"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, before I left my room to go down to breakfast, my
      servant told me that Lady de Brantefield's housekeeper, Mrs. Fowler,
      begged to speak to me&mdash;she had been come some time. I went into my
      mother's dressing-room, where she was waiting alone. I could not bear to
      fix my eyes upon her; I advanced towards her, wishing, as I believe I said
      aloud, that she had spared me the pain of this interview. I waited in
      silence for her to speak, but she did not say a word&mdash;I heard the
      unhappy woman sobbing violently. Suddenly she took her handkerchief from
      before her face, and her sobs ceasing, she exclaimed, "I know you hate me,
      Mr. Harrington, and you have reason to hate me&mdash;more&mdash;much more
      than you know of! But Lord Mowbray is the most to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood in astonishment. I conceived either that the woman was out of her
      senses, or that she had formed the not unprecedented design of affecting
      insanity, in hope of escaping the punishment of guilt: she threw herself
      at my feet&mdash;she would have clasped my knees, but I started back from
      her insufferable touch; provoked by this, she exclaimed, in a threatening
      tone, "Take care, sir!&mdash;The secret is still in my power."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then observing, I believe, that her threat made no impression, her tone
      changed again to the whine of supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Harrington, if I could hope for your forgiveness, I could reveal
      such a secret&mdash;a secret that so concerns you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I retreated, saying that I would not hear any secret from her. But I
      stopped, and was fixed to the spot, when she added, under her breath, the
      name of Montenero. Then, in a hypocritical voice, she went on&mdash;"Oh,
      Mr. Harrington!&mdash;Oh, sir, I have, been a great sinner! led on&mdash;led
      on by them that was worse than myself; but if you will plead for me with
      my lady, and prevail upon her not to bring me to public shame about this
      unfortunate affair of the ring, I will confess all to you&mdash;I will
      throw myself on your mercy. I will quit the country if you will prevail on
      my lady&mdash;to let my daughter's marriage go on, and not to turn her out
      of favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      I refused to make any terms; but my mother, whose curiosity could refrain
      no longer, burst into the room; and to her Fowler did not plead in vain.
      Shocked as she was with the detection of this woman's fraud, my mother was
      so eager to learn the secret concerning me, that she promised to obtain a
      pardon from Lady de Brantefield for the delinquent, if she would
      immediately communicate the secret. I left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met my father with letters and newspapers in his hand. He looked in
      consternation, and beckoned to me to follow him into his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was just going in search of you, Harrington," said he: "here's a devil
      of a stroke for your mother's friend, Lady de Brantefield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The loss of her jewels, do you mean, sir?" said I: "they are found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jewels!" said my father; "I don't know what you are talking of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know then what you mean, sir," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, to be sure you do not, how could you? for the news is but this
      instant come&mdash;in this letter which I was carrying to you&mdash;which
      is addressed to you, as I found, when I got to the middle of it. I beg
      your pardon for opening it. Stay, stay&mdash;this is not the right
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      My father seemed much hurried, and looked over his parcel of letters,
      while he went on, saying, "This is directed to William Harrington, instead
      of William Harrington Harrington. Never mind about that now, only I don't
      like to open letters that don't belong to me&mdash;here it is&mdash;run
      your eye over it as fast as you can, and tell me&mdash;for I stopped, as
      soon as I saw it was not to me&mdash;tell me how it is with Mowbray&mdash;I
      never liked the fellow, nor his mother either; but one can't help pitying&mdash;and
      being shocked&mdash;shocked indeed I was, the moment I read the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, which appeared to have been written in great perturbation, and
      at two or three different times, with different inks, was from a brother
      officer of Lord Mowbray's. It began in a tolerably composed and legible
      hand, with an account of a duel, in which the writer of the letter said
      that he had been second to Lord Mowbray. His lordship had been wounded,
      but it was hoped he would do well. Then came the particulars of the duel,
      which the second stated, of course, as advantageously for himself and his
      principal as he could; but even by his own statement it appeared that Lord
      Mowbray had been the aggressor; that he had been intemperate; and, in
      short, entirely in the wrong: the person with whom he fought was a young
      officer, who had been his schoolfellow: the dispute had begun about some
      trivial old school quarrel, on the most nonsensical subject; something
      about a Jew boy of the name of Jacob, and a pencil-case; the young
      gentleman had appealed to the evidence of Mr. Harrington, whom he had
      lately met on a fishing-party, and who, he said, had a perfect
      recollection of the circumstance. Lord Mowbray grew angry; and in the heat
      of contradiction, which, as his second said, his lordship could never
      bear, he gave his opponent the lie direct. A duel was the necessary
      consequence. Lord Mowbray insisted on their firing across the table: his
      opponent was compelled to it. They fired, as it was agreed, at the same
      instant: Lord Mowbray fell. So far was written while the surgeon was with
      his patient. Afterwards, the letter went on in a more confused manner. The
      surgeon begged that Lord Mowbray's friends might be informed, to prepare
      them for the event; but still there were hopes. Lord Mowbray had begun to
      write a letter to Mr. Harrington, but could not go on&mdash;had torn it to
      bits&mdash;and had desired the writer of the present letter to say, "that
      he could not go out of the world easy, without his forgiveness&mdash;to
      refer him to a woman of the name of Fowler, for explanation&mdash;a
      waiting-maid&mdash;a housekeeper now, in his mother's family. Lord Mowbray
      assured Mr. Harrington, that he did not mean to have carried the <i>jest</i>
      (the word <i>jest</i> scratched out), the thing farther than to show him
      his power to break off matters, if he pleased&mdash;but he now repented."
    </p>
    <p>
      This dictated part of the letter was so confused, and so much like the
      delirium of a man in a fever, that I should certainly have concluded it to
      be without real meaning, had it not coincided with the words which Fowler
      had said to me. On turning over the page I saw a postscript&mdash;Lord
      Mowbray, at two o'clock that morning, had expired. His brother officer
      gave no particulars, and expressed little regret, but begged me to
      represent the affair properly; and added something about the
      lieutenant-colonelcy, which was blotted so much, either purposely or
      accidentally, that I could not read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, who was a truly humane man, was excessively shocked by the
      letter; and at first, so much engrossed by the account of the manner of
      the young man's death, and by the idea of the shock and distress of the
      mother and sister, that he scarcely adverted to the unintelligible
      messages to me. He observed, indeed, that the writer of the letter seemed
      to be a fool, and to have very little feeling. We agreed that my mother
      was the fittest person to break the matter to poor Lady de Brantefield. If
      my mother should not feel herself equal to the task, my father said he
      would undertake it himself, though he had rather have a tooth pulled out
      than go through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went together to my mother. We found her in hysterics, and Fowler
      beside her; my mother, the moment she saw us, recovered some recollection,
      and pushing Fowler from her with both her hands, she cried, "Take her away&mdash;out
      of my sight&mdash;out of my sight." I took the hartshorn from Fowler, and
      bid her leave the room; ordering her, at her peril, not to leave the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you tell Mrs. Harrington so suddenly, Mrs. Fowler?" my father
      began, supposing that my mother's hysterics were the consequence of having
      been told, too suddenly, the news of Lord Mowbray's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not tell her, sir; I never uttered a sentence of his lordship's <i>death</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      In her confusion, the woman betrayed her knowledge of the circumstance,
      though on her first speaking to me she had not mentioned it. While I
      assisted and soothed my mother, I heard my father questioning her. "She
      heard the news that morning, early, in a letter from Lord Mowbray's
      gentleman&mdash;had not yet had the heart to mention it to her lady&mdash;believed
      she had given a hint of it to Lady Anne&mdash;was indeed so flurried, and
      still was so flurried&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, perceiving that Fowler did not know what she was saying,
      good-naturedly attributed her confusion to her sorrow for her ladies; and
      did not wonder, he said, she was flurried: he was not nervous, but it had
      given him a shock. "Sit down, poor Fowler."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words caught my mother's ear, who had now recovered her recollection
      completely; and with an effort, which I had never before seen her make, to
      command her own feelings&mdash;an effort, for which I thank her, as I knew
      it arose from her strong affection for me, she calmly said, "I will bear
      that woman&mdash;that fiend, in my sight, a few minutes longer, for your
      sake, Harrington, till her confession be put in writing and signed: this
      will, I suppose, be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire to know, directly, what all this means?" said my father,
      speaking in a certain repressed tone, which we and which Fowler knew to be
      the symptom of his being on the point of breaking out into violent anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir," said Fowler, "I have been a very sad sinner; but indeed I was
      not so much to blame as them that knew better, and ought to know better&mdash;that
      bribed and deceived me, and lured me by promises to do that&mdash;to say
      that&mdash;but indeed I was made to believe it was all to end in no harm&mdash;only
      a jest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A jest! Oh, wretch!" cried my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a wretch, indeed, ma'am; but Lord Mowbray was, you'll allow, the
      wickedest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And at the moment he is dead," said my father, "is this a time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fowler, terrified to her inmost coward soul at the sight of the powerful
      indignation which appeared in my father's eyes, made an attempt to throw
      herself at his feet, but he caught strong hold of her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me the plain fact at once, woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she literally could not speak; she knew my father was violent, and
      dreaded lest what she had to say should incense him beyond all bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother rose, and said that she would tell the plain fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fowler, still more afraid that my mother should tell it&mdash;as she
      thought, I suppose, she could soften it best herself&mdash;interposed,
      saying, "Sir, if you will give me a moment's time for recollection, sir, I
      will tell all. Dear sir, if one had committed murder, and was going to be
      put to death, one should have that much mercy shown&mdash;hard to be
      condemned unheard."
    </p>
    <p>
      My father let go her arm from his strong grasp, and sat down, resolved to
      be patient. It was just, he said, that she, that every human creature
      should be heard before they were condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to the facts, I was so much interested that I cannot
      recollect the exact words in which the account was given; but this was the
      substance. Lord Mowbray, when refused by Miss Montenero, had sworn that he
      would be revenged on her and on me. Indeed, from our first acquaintance
      with her, he had secretly determined to supplant me; and a circumstance
      soon occurred which served to suggest the means. He had once heard Miss
      Montenero express strongly her terror at seeing an insane person&mdash;her
      horror at the idea of a marriage which a young friend of hers had made
      with a man who was subject to fits of insanity. Upon this hint Mowbray set
      to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he opened his scheme to Fowler, he found how he could bribe her, as
      he thought, effectually, and secure her secrecy by making her an
      accomplice. Fowler had a mind to marry her daughter to a certain
      apothecary, who, though many years older than the girl, and quite old
      enough to be her father, was rich, and would raise her to be a lady. This
      apothecary lived in a country town near the Priory; the house, and ground
      belonging to it, which the apothecary rented, was on her ladyship's
      estate, and would be the inheritance of Lord Mowbray. He promised that he
      would renew this lease to her future son-in-law, provided she and the
      apothecary continued to preserve his good opinion. His lordship had often
      questioned Fowler as to the strange nervous fits I had had when a boy. He
      had repeated all he had heard reported; and certainly exaggerated stories
      in abundance had, at the time, been circulated. Lord Mowbray affirmed that
      most people were of opinion it was <i>insanity</i>. Fowler admitted that
      was always her own opinion&mdash;Lord Mowbray supposed that was the secret
      reason for her quitting my mother's service&mdash;it certainly was, though
      she was too delicate, and afraid at the time, to mention it. By degrees he
      worked Fowler partly to acquiesce in all he asserted, and to assert all he
      insinuated. The apothecary had been an apprentice to the London apothecary
      who attended me; he had seen me often at the time I was at the <i>worst</i>;
      he had heard the reports too, and he had heard opinions of medical men,
      and he was brought to assert whatever his future mother-in-law pleased,
      for he was much in love with the young girl. This combination was formed
      about the period when I first became attached to Miss Montenero: the last
      stroke had been given at the time when Mr. Montenero and Berenice were at
      General B&mdash;&mdash;'s, in Surrey. The general's house was within a few
      miles of the country town in which the said apothecary lived; it was ten
      or twelve miles from the Priory, where Fowler was left, at that time, to
      take care of the place. The apothecary usually attended the chief families
      in the neighbourhood, and was recommended to General B&mdash;&mdash;'s
      family. Miss Montenero had a slight sore throat, and no physician being
      near, this apothecary was sent for; he made use of this opportunity, spoke
      of the friends he had formerly had in London, in particular of Mr.
      Harrington's family, for whom he expressed much gratitude and attachment;
      inquired anxiously and mysteriously about young Mr. Harrington's state of
      health. One day Miss Montenero and her father called at this apothecary's,
      to see some curious things that had been found in a Roman bath, just dug
      up in the county of Surrey. Fowler, who had been apprised of the intended
      visit, was found in the little parlour behind the shop talking to the
      apothecary about poor young Mr. Harrington. While Mr. and Miss Montenero
      were looking at the Roman curiosities, Fowler contrived, in half
      sentences, to let out what she wished to be overheard about <i>that</i>
      poor young gentleman's <i>strange fits</i>; and she questioned the
      apothecary whether they had come on ever <i>very</i> lately, and hoped
      that for the family's sake, as well as his own, it would never break out
      publicly. All which observations and questions the apothecary seemed
      discreetly and mysteriously to evade answering. Fowler confessed that she
      could not get out on this occasion the whole of what she had been
      instructed to say, because Miss Montenero grew so pale, they thought she
      would have dropped on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apothecary pretended to think the young lady had been made sick by the
      smell of the shop. It passed off&mdash;nothing more was done at that time.
      Mr. Montenero, before he left the house, made inquiries who Fowler was&mdash;learned
      that she had been, for many years, a servant in the Harrington family,&mdash;children's
      maid. Her evidence, and that of the apothecary who had attended me in my
      <i>extraordinary illness</i>, agreed; and there seemed no reason to
      suspect its truth. Mr. and Miss Montenero went with a party from General B&mdash;&mdash;'s
      to see Brantefield Priory. Fowler attended the company through the house:
      Mr. Montenero took occasion to question her most minutely&mdash;asked, in
      particular, about a tapestry room&mdash;a picture of Sir Josseline and the
      Jew&mdash;received such answers as Lord Mowbray had prepared Fowler to
      give: so artfully had he managed, that his interference could not be
      suspected. Fowler pretended to know scarcely any thing of her young lord&mdash;she
      had always lived here at the Priory&mdash;his lordship had been abroad&mdash;was
      in the army&mdash;always <i>on the move</i>&mdash;did not know where he
      was now&mdash;probably in town: her present ladies had her good word&mdash;but
      her heart, she confessed, was always with her first mistress, Mrs.
      Harrington, and poor Master Harrington&mdash;<i>never to be mentioned
      without a sigh</i>&mdash;that was noted in her instructions. All that I or
      Mowbray had mentioned before Mr. Montenero of my aversion to Fowler, now
      appeared to be but the dislike which an insane person is apt to take
      against those about them, even to those who treat them most kindly. Fowler
      was a good actress, and she was well prompted&mdash;she produced, in her
      own justification, instructions, in unsigned letters of Lord Mowbray's. I
      knew his hand, however disguised. She was directed to take particular care
      not to go too far&mdash;to let things be <i>drawn</i> from her&mdash;to
      refuse to give further information lest she should do mischief. When
      assured that the Monteneros were friends, then to tell <i>circumstances
      agreed upon</i>&mdash;to end with a promise to produce a <i>keeper</i> who
      had attended the poor gentleman not long since, who could satisfy all
      doubts. Lord Mowbray noted that this must be promised to be done within
      the ensuing month&mdash;something about a ship's sailing for America was
      scratched out in these last instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have calmly related the facts, but I cannot give an idea of the
      transports of passion into which my father burst when he heard them. It
      was with the utmost difficulty that we could restrain him till the woman
      had finished her confession. Lord Mowbray was dead. His death&mdash;his
      penitence&mdash;pity for his family, quenched my father's rage against
      Mowbray; all his fury rose with tenfold violence against Fowler. It was
      with the greatest difficulty that I got her out of the room in safety:&mdash;he
      followed, raging; and my mother, seeing me put Fowler into a parlour, and
      turn the key in the door, began beseeching that I would not keep her
      another instant in the house. I insisted, however, upon being permitted to
      detain her till her confession should be put into writing, or till Mr.
      Montenero could hear it from her own lips: I represented that if once she
      quitted the house, we might never see her again; she might make her escape
      out of town; might, for some new interest, deny all she had said, and
      leave me in as great difficulties as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, sudden in all his emotions, snatched his hat from the
      hall-table, seized his cane, and declared he would that instant go and
      settle the point at once with Mr. Montenero and the daughter. My mother
      and I, one on each side of him, pleaded that it would be best not to speak
      so suddenly as he proposed to do, especially to Berenice. Heaven bless my
      mother! she called her <i>Berenice</i>: this did not escape my ear. My
      father let us take off his hat, and carry away his cane. He sat down and
      wrote directly to Mr. Montenero, requesting to see him immediately, on
      particular business.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother's carriage was at the door; it was by this time the hour for
      visiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will bring Mr. Montenero back with me," said my mother, "for I am going
      to pay a visit I should have paid long ago&mdash;to Miss Montenero."
    </p>
    <p>
      I kissed my mother's hand I don't know how many times, till my father told
      me I was a <i>fool</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," turning to me, when the carriage had driven off, "though I am
      delighted that the <i>obstacle</i> will be removed on their part, yet
      remember, Harrington, I can go no farther&mdash;not an inch&mdash;not an
      inch: sorry for it&mdash;but you know all I have said&mdash;by Jupiter
      Ammon, I cannot eat my own words!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you ought to eat your own words, sir," said I, venturing to jest, as
      I knew that I might in his present humour, and while his heart was warmed;
      "your words were a libel upon Jews and Jewesses; and the most appropriate
      and approved punishment invented for the libeller is&mdash;to eat his own
      words."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My mother returned almost as quickly as my impatience expected, and from
      afar I saw that Mr. Montenero was in the carriage with her. My heart did
      certainly beat violently; but I must not stop to describe, if I could, my
      various sensations. My mother, telling Mr. Montenero all the time that she
      would tell him nothing, had told him every thing that was to be told: I
      was glad of it&mdash;it spared me the task of detailing Lord Mowbray's
      villany. He had once been my friend, or at least I had once been his&mdash;and
      just after his death it was a painful subject. Besides, on my own account,
      I was heartily glad to leave it to my father to complete what my mother
      had so well begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with great vehemence. I stood by, proud all the time to show Mr.
      Montenero my calmness and self-possession; while Fowler, who was under
      salutary terror of my father, repeated, without much prevarication, all
      the material parts of her confession, and gave up to him Lord Mowbray's
      letters. Astonishment and horror at the discovery of such villany were Mr.
      Montenero's first feelings&mdash;he looked at Lord Mowbray's writing again
      and again, and shuddered in silence, as he cast his eyes upon Fowler's
      guilty countenance. We all were glad when she was dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero turned to me, and I saw tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no obstacle between us now, I hope," said I, eagerly seizing the
      hand which he held out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero pressed me in his arms, with the affection of a parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heyday! heyday!" said my father, in a tone between pleasure and anger,&mdash;"do
      you at all know what you are about, Harrington?&mdash;remember!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mr. Montenero," said my mother, "speak, for Heaven's sake, and tell
      me that you are perfectly convinced that there was no shadow of truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! my dear, I beg your pardon, Mrs. Harrington," said my father,&mdash;"to
      be sure he is convinced, he is not an idiot&mdash;all my astonishment is,
      how he could ever be made to believe such a thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero answered my mother and my father alternately, assuring my
      mother that he was quite convinced, and agreeing with my father that he
      had been strangely imposed upon. He turned again to me, and I believe at
      the same instant the same recollections occurred to us both&mdash;new
      light seemed to break upon us, and we saw in a different point of view a
      variety of past circumstances. Almost from the moment of my acquaintance
      with Berenice, I could trace Lord Mowbray's artifices. Even from the time
      of our first going out together at Westminster Abbey, when Mr. Montenero
      said he loved enthusiasm, how Mowbray encouraged, excited me to follow
      that line. At the Tower, my kneeling in raptures to the figure of the
      Black Prince&mdash;my exaggerated expressions of enthusiasm&mdash;my
      poetic and dramatic declamation and gesture&mdash;my start of horror at
      Mowbray's allusion to the <i>tapestry-chamber</i> and the picture of Sir
      Josseline&mdash;my horror afterwards at the auction, where Mowbray had
      prepared for me the sight of the picture of the Dentition of the Jew&mdash;and
      the appearance of the figure with the terrible eyes at the synagogue; all,
      I now found, had been contrived or promoted by Lord Mowbray: Fowler had
      dressed up the figure for the purpose. They had taken the utmost pains to
      work on my imagination on this particular point, on which he knew my early
      associations might betray me to symptoms of apparent insanity. Upon
      comparing and explaining these circumstances, Mr. Montenero further laid
      open to me the treacherous ingenuity of the man who had so duped me by the
      show of sympathy and friendship. By dexterous insinuations he had first
      excited curiosity&mdash;then suggested suspicions, worked every accidental
      circumstance to his purpose, and at last, rendered desperate by despair,
      and determined that I should not win the prize which he had been compelled
      to resign, had employed so boldly his means and accomplices, that he was
      dreadfully near effecting my ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Montenero and I ran over all these circumstances, understanding
      each other perfectly, but scarcely intelligible to either my father or
      mother, they looked at us both with impatience and surprise, and rejoiced
      when we had finished our explanations&mdash;and yet, when we had finished,
      an embarrassing minute of silence ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother broke it, by saying something about Miss Montenero. I do not
      know what&mdash;nor did she. My father stood with a sort of bravadoing
      look of firmness, fixing himself opposite to me, as though he were
      repeating to himself, "If, sir!&mdash;If&mdash;By Jupiter Ammon! I must be
      consistent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montenero appeared determined not to say any more, but something
      seemed to be still in reserve in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, Mr. Montenero," said I, "that now no obstacle exists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my part none," replied Mr. Montenero; "but you recollect&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recollect only your own words, my dear sir," cried I. "'either my
      daughter and you must never meet again, or must meet to part no more'&mdash;I
      claim your promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all hazards?" said Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No hazards with such a woman as Berenice," said I, "though her religion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would give," exclaimed my father, "I would give one of my fingers this
      instant, that she was not a Jewess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your objection, sir, to her not being a Christian, or to her being the
      daughter of a Jew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you conceive, Mr. Montenero," cried my father, "that after all I have
      seen of you&mdash;all you have done for me&mdash;can you conceive me to be
      such an obstinately prejudiced brute? My r prejudices against the Jews I
      give up&mdash;you have conquered them&mdash;all, all. But a difference of
      religion between man and wife&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is a very serious objection indeed," said Mr. Montenero; "but if that be
      the only objection left in your mind, I have the pleasure to tell you, Mr.
      Harrington," addressing himself to me, "that your love and duty are not at
      variance: I have tried you to the utmost, and am satisfied both of the
      steadiness of your principles and of the strength of your attachment to my
      daughter&mdash;Berenice is not a Jewess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a Jewess!" cried my father, starting from his spat: "Not a Jewess!
      Then my Jupiter Ammon may go to the devil! Not a Jewess!&mdash;give you
      joy, Harrington, my boy!&mdash;give me joy, my dear Mrs. Harrington&mdash;give
      me joy, excellent&mdash;(<i>Jew</i>, he was on the point of saying)
      excellent Mr. Montenero; but, is not she your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is, I hope and believe, my daughter," said Mr. Montenero smiling;
      "but her mother was a Christian; and according to my promise to Mrs.
      Montenero, Berenice has been bred in her faith&mdash;a Christian&mdash;a
      Protestant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Christian! a Protestant!" repeated my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An English Protestant: her mother was daughter of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An English Protestant!" interrupted my father, "English! English! Do you
      hear that, Mrs. Harrington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven! I do hear it, my dear," said my mother. "But, Mr.
      Montenero, we interrupt&mdash;daughter of&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daughter of an English gentleman, of good family, who accompanied one of
      your ambassadors to Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of good family, Mr. Harrington," said my mother, raising her head proudly
      as she looked at me with a radiant countenance: "I knew she was of a good
      family from the first moment I saw her at the play&mdash;so different from
      the people she was with&mdash;even Lady de Brantefield asked who she was.
      From the first moment I thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You thought, Mrs. Harrington," interposed my father, "you thought, to be
      sure, that Miss Montenero <i>looked like a Christian</i>. Yes, yes; and no
      doubt you had <i>presentiments</i> plenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granted, granted, my dear; but don't let us say any more about them now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my boy! well, Harrington! not a word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I am too happy!&mdash;the delight I feel&mdash;But, my dear Mr.
      Montenero," said I, "why&mdash;<i>why</i> did not you tell all this
      sooner? What pain you would have spared me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had I spared you the pain, you would never have enjoyed the delight; had
      I spared you the trial, you would never have had the triumph&mdash;the
      triumph, did I say? Better than all triumph, this sober certainty of your
      own integrity. If, like Lord Mowbray&mdash;but peace be to the dead! and
      forgiveness to his faults. My daughter was determined never to marry any
      man who could be induced to sacrifice religion and principle to interest
      or to passion. She was equally determined never to marry any man whose
      want of the spirit of toleration, whose prejudices against the Jews, might
      interfere with the filial affection she feels for her father&mdash;though
      he be a Jew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Though</i>"&mdash;Gratitude, joy, love, so overwhelmed me at this
      moment, that I could not say another syllable; but it was enough for Mr.
      Montenero, deeply read as he was in the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did not I spare you the pain?" repeated he. "And do you think that
      the trial cost <i>me</i>, cost <i>us</i> no pain?" said Mr. Montenero.
      "The time may come when, as my son, you may perhaps learn from Berenice&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The time is come!&mdash;this moment!" cried my father; "for you see the
      poor fellow is burning with impatience&mdash;he would not be my son if he
      were not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true, indeed!" said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;very likely," said Mr. Montenero, calmly holding me fast.
      "But, impetuous sir, recollect that once before you were too sudden for
      Berenice: after you had saved my life, you rushed in with the joyful news,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no rushing, for mercy's sake, Harrington!" said my mother: "some
      consideration for Miss Montenero's nerves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nerves! nonsense, my dear," said my father: "what woman's nerves were
      ever the worse for seeing her lover at her feet? I move&mdash;and I am
      sure of one honourable gentleman to second my motion&mdash;I move that we
      all adjourn, forthwith, to Mr. Montenero's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This evening, perhaps, Miss Montenero would allow us," said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This instant," said Mr. Montenero, "if you will do me the honour, Mrs.
      Harrington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The carriage," said my mother, ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The carriage, directly," cried my father to the servant as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a fellow will certainly fly the moment you let him go," said my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      And away I flew, with such swiftness, that at the foot of the stairs I
      almost fell over Jacob. He, not knowing any thing of what had happened
      this morning, full of the events of the preceding night, and expecting to
      find me the same, began to say something about a ring which he held in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all settled&mdash;all over&mdash;let me pass, good Jacob."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he endeavoured to stop me. I was not pleased with this interruption.
      But there was something so beseeching and so kind in Jacob's manner that I
      could not help attending to him. Had the poor fellow known the cause of my
      impatience, he would mot certainly have detained me. He begged me, with
      some hesitation, to accept of a ring, which Mr. Manessa his partner and he
      took the liberty of offering me as a token of their gratitude. It was not
      of any great value, but it was finished by an artist who was supposed to
      be one of the best in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly, Jacob," said I; "and it comes at the happiest moment&mdash;if
      you will allow me to present it, to offer it to a lady, who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will, I hope," said my father, appearing at the top of the stairs,
      "soon be his bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His bride!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob saw Mr. Montenero's face behind me, and clasping his, hands, "The
      very thing I wished!" cried he, opening the house-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow us, Jacob," I heard Mr. Montenero say, as we stepped into the
      carriage; "follow us to the house of joy, you who never deserted the house
      of mourning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring, the history of it, and the offering it to Berenice, prepared my
      way in the happiest manner, and prevented the danger, which Mr. Montenero
      feared, of my own or my father's precipitation. We told her in general the
      circumstances that had happened, but spared her the detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, my beloved daughter," said Mr. Montenero, "I may express to you
      all the esteem, all the affection, all the fulness of approbation I feel
      for <i>your choice</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, Miss Montenero!&mdash;Let me speak, pray, Mrs. Harrington," said
      my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By and by," whispered my mother; "not yet, my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, put the ring on her finger&mdash;that's right, boy!" cried my father,
      as my mother drew him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berenice accepted of the ring in the most gracious, the most graceful
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept this with pleasure," said she; "I shall prize it more than ever
      Lady de Brantefield valued her ring: as a token of goodness and gratitude,
      it will be more precious to me than any, jewel could be; and it will ever
      be dear to me," added she, with a softened voice, turning to her father,
      "very dear, as a memorial of the circumstances which have removed the only
      obstacle to, <i>our</i> happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our," repeated my father: "noble girl! Above all affectation. Boy, a
      truce with your transports! She is my own daughter&mdash;I must have a
      kiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame, my dear," said my mother; "you make Miss Montenero blush!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blushes are very becoming&mdash;I always thought yours so, Mrs.
      Harrington&mdash;that's the reason I have given you occasion to blush for
      me so often. Now you may take me out of the room, madam. I have some
      discretion, though you think you have it all to yourself," said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have some discretion, too, hereditary or acquired. I am aware that the
      moment two lovers cease to be miserable, they begin to be tiresome; their
      best friends and the generous public are satisfied to hear as little as
      possible concerning their prosperous loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was otherwise, they say, in the days of Theagenes and Chariclea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How! will you never be satisfied with hearing?" says their historian,
      who, when he came to a prosperous epoch in their history, seems to have
      had a discreet suspicion that he might be too long; "Is not my discourse
      yet tedious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," the indefatigable auditor is made to reply; "and who is he, unless
      he have a heart of adamant or iron, that would not listen content to hear
      the loves of Theagenes and Chariclea, though the story should last a year?
      Therefore, continue it, I beseech you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Continue, I beseech you:" dear flattering words! Though perhaps no one,
      at this minute, says or feels this, I must add a few lines more&mdash;not
      about myself, but about Mr. Montenero.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment of joy, when the heart opens, you can see to the very bottom
      of it; and whether selfish or generous, revengeful or forgiving, the real
      disposition is revealed. We were all full of joy and congratulations, when
      Mr. Montenero, at the first pause of silence, addressed himself in his
      most persuasive tone to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Harrington&mdash;good Mr. Harrington&mdash;I have a favour to ask
      from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A favour! from me! Oh! name it," cried I: "What pleasure I shall have in
      granting it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not. You will not have pleasure&mdash;immediate pleasure&mdash;in
      granting it: it will cost you present pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pain!&mdash;impossible! but no matter how much pain if you desire it.
      What can it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wretched woman&mdash;Fowler!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I shuddered and started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Fowler&mdash;your imagination revolts at the sound of her name&mdash;she
      is abhorrent to your strongest, your earliest, associations; but, Mr.
      Harrington, you have given proofs that your matured reason and your
      humanity have been able to control and master your imagination and your
      antipathies. To this power over yourself you owe many of your virtues, and
      all the strength of character, and, I will say it, the sanity of mind, my
      son, without which Berenice&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see&mdash;I will hear Fowler this instant," cried I. "So far I
      will conquer myself; but you will allow that this is a just antipathy.
      Surely I have reason to hate her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is guilty, but penitent; she suffers and must suffer. Her mistress
      refuses ever to see her more. She is abandoned by all her family, all her
      friends; she must quit her country&mdash;sails to-morrow in the vessel
      which was to have taken us to America&mdash;and carries with her, in her
      own feelings, her worst punishment&mdash;a punishment which it is not in
      our power to remit, but it is in our power to mitigate her sufferings&mdash;I
      can provide her with an asylum for the remainder of her miserable old age;
      and you, my son, before she goes from happy England, see her and forgive
      her. 'It is the glory of a man to pass by an offence.' Let us see and
      forgive this woman. How can we better celebrate our joy&mdash;how can we
      better fill the measure of our happiness, than by the forgiveness of our
      enemies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jupiter Ammon," cried my father, "none but a good Christian could do
      this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why," said Berenice, laying her hand gently on my father's arm, "and
      why not a good Jew?"
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      THOUGHTS ON BORES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A bore is a biped, but not always unplumed. There be of both kinds;&mdash;the
      female frequently plumed, the <i>male-military</i> plumed, helmed, or
      crested, and whisker-faced, hairy, <i>Dandy bore</i>, ditto, ditto, ditto.&mdash;There
      are bores unplumed, capped, or hatted, curled or uncurled, bearded and
      beardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>bore</i> is not a ruminating animal,&mdash;carnivorous, not
      sagacious&mdash;prosing&mdash;long-winded&mdash;tenacious of life, though
      not vivacious. The bore is good for promoting sleep; but though he causeth
      sleep in others, it is uncertain whether he ever sleeps himself; as few
      can keep awake in his company long enough to see. It is supposed that when
      he sleeps it is with his mouth open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bore is usually considered a harmless creature, or of that class of
      irrational bipeds who hurt only themselves. To such, however, I would not
      advise trusting too much. The bore is harmless, no doubt, as long as you
      listen to him; but disregarded, or stopped in mid-career, he will turn
      upon you. It is a fatal, if not a vulgar error, to presume that the bore
      belongs to that class of animals that have no gall; of which Pliny gives a
      list (much disputed by Sir Thomas Browne and others). That bores have
      gall, many have proved to their cost, as some now living, peradventure,
      can attest. The milk of human kindness is said to abound naturally in
      certain of the gentler bore kind; but it is apt to grow sour if the animal
      be crossed&mdash;not in love, but in talk. Though I cannot admit to a
      certainty that all bores have not gall, yet assuredly they have no tact,
      and they are one and all deficient in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bore is a heavy animal, and his weight has this peculiarity, that it
      increases every moment he stays near you. The French describe this
      property in one word, which, though French, I may be permitted to quote,
      because untranslatable, <i>il s'appesantit</i>&mdash;Touch and go, it is
      not in the nature of a bore to do&mdash;whatever he touches turns to lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much learning might be displayed, and much time wasted, on an inquiry into
      the derivation, descent, and etymology of the animal under consideration.
      Suffice it to say, that for my own part, diligence hath not been wanting
      in the research. Johnson's Dictionary and old Bailey, have been ransacked;
      but neither the learned Johnson, nor the recondite Bailey, throw much
      light upon this matter. The Slang Dictionary, to which I should in the
      first place have directed my attention, was unfortunately not within my
      reach. The result of all my inquiries amounts to this&mdash;that <i>bore</i>,
      <i>boor</i>, and <i>boar</i>, are all three spelt indifferently, and <i>consequently</i>
      are derived from one common stock,&mdash;what stock, remains to be
      determined. I could give a string of far-fetched derivations, each of them
      less to the purpose than the other; but I prefer, according to the
      practice of our great lexicographer, taking refuge at once in the Coptic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of one point there can be little doubt&mdash;that bores existed in ancient
      as well as in modern times, though the deluge has unluckily swept away all
      traces of the antediluvian bore&mdash;a creature which analogy leads us to
      believe must have been of formidable power.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find them for certain in the days of Horace. That plague, worse, as he
      describes, than asthma or rheumatism, that prating, praising thing which
      caught him in the street, stuck to him wherever he went&mdash;of which,
      stopping or running, civil or rude, shirking or cutting, he could never
      rid himself&mdash;what was he but a bore?
    </p>
    <p>
      In Pope I find the first description in English poetry of the animal&mdash;whether
      imitated from Horace, or a drawing from life, may be questioned. But what
      could that creature be but a bore, from whom he says no walls could guard
      him, and no shades could hide; who pierced his thickets; glided into his
      grotto; stopped his chariot; boarded his barge; from whom no place was
      sacred&mdash;not the church free; and against whom John was ordered to tie
      up the knocker?
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the indexes to Milton and Shakspeare I have not neglected to hunt;
      but unfortunately, I have found nothing to my purpose in Milton, and in
      all Shakspeare no trace of a bore; except it be that <i>thing</i>, that
      popinjay, who so pestered Hotspur, that day when he, faint with toil and
      dry with rage, was leaning on his sword after the battle&mdash;all that
      bald, disjointed talk, to which Hotspur, past his patience, answered
      neglectingly, he knew not what, and that sticking to him with questions
      even when his wounds were cold. It must have been a bore of foreign breed,
      not the good downright English bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the classes, orders, genera, and species of the animal, I pretend not
      to enumerate. Heaven forefend!&mdash;but some of those most commonly met
      with in England, I may mention, and a few of the most curious, describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, there is the <i>mortal great bore</i>, confined to the
      higher classes of society. A celebrated wit, who, from his long and
      extensive acquaintance with the fashionable and political world, has had
      every means of forming his opinion on this subject, lays it down as an
      axiom, that none but a rich man, or a great man, <i>can</i> be a great
      bore; others are not endured long enough in society, to come to the
      perfection of tiresomeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these there is the travelled and the untravelled kind. The travelled,
      formerly rare, is now dreadfully common in these countries. The old
      travelling bore was, as I find him aptly described&mdash;"A pretender to
      antiquities, roving, majestic-headed, and sometimes little better than
      crazed; and being exceedingly credulous, he would stuff his many letters
      with <i>fooleries</i> and misinformations"&mdash;<i>vide</i> a life
      published by Hearne&mdash;Thomas Hearne&mdash;him to whom Time said,
      "Whatever I forget, you learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern travelled bore is a garrulous creature. His talk, chiefly of
      himself, of all that he has seen that is incredible; and all that he
      remembers which is not worth remembering. His tongue is neither English,
      French, Italian, or German, but a leash, and more than a leash, of
      languages at once. Besides his having his <i>quantum</i> of the ills that
      flesh is subject to, he has some peculiar to himself, and rather
      extraordinary. He is subject, for instance, to an indigestion of houses
      and churches, pictures and statues. Moreover, he is troubled with fits of
      what may be called <i>the cold enthusiasm</i>; he babbles of Mont Blanc
      and the picturesque; and when the fit is on, he raves of Raphael and
      Correggio, Rome, Athens, Paestum, and Jerusalem. He despises England, and
      has no home; or at least loves none.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have been already guilty of an error of arrangement; I should have
      given precedence to the <i>old original English bore</i>; which should
      perhaps be more properly spelt <i>boor</i>; indeed it was so, as late as
      the time of Mrs. Cowley, who, in the Belle's Stratagem, talks of man's
      being <i>boored</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>boor</i> is now rare in England, though there are specimens of him
      still to be seen in remote parts of the country. He is untravelled always,
      not apt to be found straying, or stirring from home. His covering is
      home-spun, his drink home-brewed, his meat home-fed, and himself
      home-bred. In general, he is a wonderfully silent animal. But there are
      talking ones; and their talk is of bullocks. Talking or silent, the
      indigenous English bore is somewhat sulky, surly, seemingly morose; yet
      really good-natured, inoffensive, if kindly used and rightly taken;
      convivial, yet not social. It is curious, that though addicted to home, he
      is not properly domestic&mdash;bibulous&mdash;said to be despotic with the
      female.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The parliamentary bore</i> comes next in order. Fond of high places;
      but not always found in them. His civil life is but short, never extending
      above seven years at the utmost; seldom so long. His dissolution often
      occurs, we are told, prematurely; but he revives another and the same.&mdash;Mode
      of life:&mdash;during five or six months of the year these bores inhabit
      London&mdash;are to be seen every where, always looking as if they were
      out of their element. About June or July they migrate to the country&mdash;to
      watering places&mdash;or to their own places; where they shoot partridges,
      pheasants, and wild ducks; hunt hares and foxes, cause men to be
      imprisoned or transported who do the same without <i>licence</i>; and
      frank letters&mdash;some illegibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parliamentary bore is not considered a sagacious animal, except in one
      particular. It is said that he always knows which way the wind blows,
      quick as any of the four-footed swinish multitude. Report says also that
      he has the instinct of a rat in quitting a falling house. An incredible
      power was once attributed to him, by one from Ireland, of being able at
      pleasure to turn his back upon himself. But this may well be classed among
      vulgar errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the common parliamentary bore there be two orders; the silent, and the
      speechifying. The silent is not absolutely deprived of utterance; he can
      say "Yes" or "No"&mdash;but regularly in the wrong place, unless well
      tutored and well paid. The talking parliamentary bore can outwatch the
      Bear. He reiterates eternally with the art peculiar to the rational
      creature of using many words and saying nothing. The following are some of
      the cries by which this class is distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear! Hear! Hear!&mdash;Hear him! Hear him! Hear him!&mdash;Speaker!
      Speaker! Speaker! Speaker!&mdash;Order! Order! Order!&mdash;Hear the
      honourable member!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He has besides certain set phrases, which, if repeated with variations,
      might give the substance of what are called his speeches; some of these
      are common to both sides of the house, others sacred to the ministerial,
      or popular on the opposition benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the ministerial belong&mdash;"The dignity of this house"&mdash;"The
      honour of this country"&mdash;"The contentment of our allies"&mdash;"Strengthening
      the hands of government"&mdash;"Expediency"&mdash;"Inexpediency"&mdash;"Imperious
      necessity"&mdash;"Bound in duty"&mdash;with a good store of <i>evasives</i>,
      as "Cannot at present bring forward such a measure"&mdash;"Too late"&mdash;"Too
      early in the session"&mdash;"His majesty's ministers cannot be responsible
      for"&mdash;"Cannot take it upon me to say"&mdash;"But the impression left
      upon my mind is"&mdash;"Cannot undertake to answer exactly that question"&mdash;"Cannot
      yet <i>make up</i> my mind" (an expression borrowed from the laundress).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposition side the phrases chiefly in use amongst the bores are,
      "The constitution of this country"&mdash;"Reform in Parliament"&mdash;"The
      good of the people"&mdash;"Inquiry should be set on foot"&mdash;"Ministers
      should be answerable with their heads"&mdash;"Gentlemen should draw
      together"&mdash;"Independence"&mdash;and "Consistency."
    </p>
    <p>
      Approved beginnings of speeches as follows&mdash;for a raw bore:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unused as I am to public speaking, Mr. Speaker, I feel myself on the
      present occasion called upon not to give a silent vote."
    </p>
    <p>
      For old stagers:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the whole course of my parliamentary career, never did I rise with
      such diffidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply, the bore begins with:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be presumption in me, Mr. Speaker, after the able, luminous,
      learned, and eloquent speech you have just heard, to attempt to throw any
      new light; but, &amp;c. &amp;c."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a premeditated harangue of four hours or upwards he regularly
      commences with
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this late hour of the night, I shall trouble the house with only a few
      words, Mr. Speaker."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker of the English House of Commons is a man destined to be bored.
      Doomed to sit in a chair all night long&mdash;night after night&mdash;month
      after month&mdash;year after year&mdash;being bored. No relief for him but
      crossing and uncrossing his legs from time to time. No respite. If he
      sleep, it must be with his eyes open, fixed in the direction of the
      haranguing bore. He is not, however, bound, <i>bon fide</i> to hear all
      that is said. This, happily, was settled in the last century. "Mr.
      Speaker, it is your duty to hear me,&mdash;it is the undoubted privilege,
      Sir, of every member of this house <i>to be heard</i>," said a bore of the
      last century to the then Speaker of the House of Commons. "Sir," replied
      the Speaker, "I know that it is the undoubted right of every member of
      this house to speak, but I was not aware that it was his privilege to be
      always heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtier-bore has sometimes crept into the English parliament.&mdash;But
      is common on the continent: infinite varieties, as <i>le courtisan propre,
      courtisan homme d'tat</i>, and <i>le courtisan philosophe</i>&mdash;a
      curious but not a rare kind in France, of which M. de Voltaire was one of
      the finest specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempts had been made to naturalize some of the varieties of the
      philanthropic and sentimental French and German bores in England, but
      without success. Some ladies had them for favourites or pets; but they
      were found mischievous and dangerous. Their morality was easy,&mdash;but
      difficult to understand; compounded of three-fourths sentiment&mdash;nine-tenths
      selfishness, twelve-ninths instinct, self-devotion, metaphysics, and cant.
      'Twas hard to come at a common denominator. John Bull, with his four rules
      of vulgar arithmetic, could never make it out; altogether he never could
      abide these foreign bores. Thought 'em confounded dull too&mdash;Civilly
      told them so, and half asleep bid them "prythee begone"&mdash;They not
      taking the hint, but lingering with the women, at last John wakening
      out-right, fell to in earnest, and routed them out of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      They still flourish abroad, often seen at the tables of the great. <i>The
      demi-philosophe-moderne-politico-legislativo-metaphysico-non-logico-grand
      philanthrope</i> still scribbles, by the ream, <i>pices justificatives</i>,
      <i>projets de loi</i>, and volumes of metaphysical sentiment, to be seen
      at the fair of Leipzig, or on ladies' tables. The greater bore, the <i>courtisan
      propre</i>, is still admired at little <i>serene</i> courts, where,
      well-dressed and well-drilled&mdash;his back much bent with Germanic bows;
      not a dangerous creature&mdash;would only bore you to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      We come next to our own <i>blue bores</i>&mdash;the most dreaded of the
      species,&mdash;the most abused&mdash;sometimes with reason, sometimes
      without. This species was formerly rare in Britain&mdash;indeed all over
      the world.&mdash;Little known from the days of Aspasia and Corinna to
      those of Madame Dacier and Mrs. Montague. Mr. Jerningham's blue worsted
      stockings, as all the world knows, appearing at Mrs. Montague's <i>conversaziones</i>,
      had the honour or the dishonour of giving the name of blue stockings to
      all the race; and never did race increase more rapidly than they have done
      from that time to this. There might be fear that all the daughters of the
      land should turn blue.&mdash;But as yet John Bull&mdash;thank Heaven!
      retains his good old privilege of "choose a wife and have a wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      The common female blue is indeed intolerable as a wife&mdash;opinionative
      and opinionated; and her opinion always is that her husband is wrong. John
      certainly has a rooted aversion to this whole class. There is the deep
      blue and the light; the <i>light</i> blues not esteemed&mdash;not admitted
      at Almacks. The deep-dyed in the nine times dyed blue&mdash;is that with
      which no man dares contend. The <i>blue chatterer</i> is seen and heard
      every where; it no man will attempt to silence by throwing the
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next species&mdash;the <i>mock blue</i>&mdash;is scarcely worth
      noticing; gone to ladies' maids, dress-makers, milliners, &amp;c., found
      of late behind counters, and in the oddest places. <i>The blue mocking
      bird</i> (it must be noted, though nearly allied to the last sort) is
      found in high as well as in low company; it is a provoking creature. The
      only way to silence it, and to prevent it from plaguing all neighbours and
      passengers, is never to mind it, or to look as if you minded it; when it
      stares at you, stare and pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The conversazione blue</i>, or <i>bureau d'esprit blue</i>. It is
      remarkable that in order to designate this order we are obliged to borrow
      from two foreign languages.&mdash;a proof that it is not natural to
      England; but numbers of this order have been seen of late years, chiefly
      in London and Bath, during the season. The <i>bureau d'esprit</i>, or <i>conversazione
      blue</i>, is a most hard-working creature&mdash;the servant of the
      servants of the public.&mdash;If a dinner-giving blue (and none others
      succeed well or long), Champagne and ice and the best of fish are
      indispensable. She may then be at home once a week in the evening, with a
      chance of having her house fuller than it can hold, of all the would-be
      wits and three or four of the leaders of London. Very thankful she must be
      for the honour of their company. She had need to have all the
      superlatives, in and out of the English language, at her tongue's end; and
      when she has exhausted these, then she must invent new. She must have
      tones of admiration, and looks of ecstasy, for every occasion. At reading
      parties,&mdash;especially at her own house, she must cry&mdash;"charming!"&mdash;"delightful!"
      "quite original!" in the right places even in her sleep.&mdash;Awake or
      asleep she must read every thing that comes out that has a name, or she
      must talk as if she had&mdash;at her peril&mdash;to the authors
      themselves,&mdash;the irritable race!&mdash;She must know more especially
      every article in the Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews; and at her peril
      too, must talk of these so as not to commit herself, so as to please the
      reviewer abusing, and the author abused; she must keep the peace between
      rival wits;&mdash;she must swallow her own vanity&mdash;many fail in this
      last attempt&mdash;choke publicly, and give it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry that so much has been said about the blues; sorry I mean that
      such a hue and cry has been raised against them all, good, bad, and
      indifferent. John Bull would have settled it best in his quiet way by just
      letting them alone, leaving the disagreeable ones to die off in single
      blessedness. But people got about John, and made him set up one of his "<i>No
      popery</i>" cries; and when becomes to that pitch be loses his senses and
      his common sense completely. "<i>No blues!</i>" "Down with the blues!"&mdash;now
      what good has all that done? only made the matter ten times worse. In
      consequence of this universal hubbub a new order of things has arisen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The blue bore disguised, or the renegade blue</i>. These may be
      detected by their extraordinary fear of being taken for <i>blues</i>. Hold
      up the picture, or even the sign of a blue bore before them, and they
      immediately write under it, "'Tis none of me." They spend their lives
      hiding their talent under a bushel; all the time in a desperate fright
      lest you should see it. A poor simple man does not know what to do about
      it, or what to say or think in their company, so as to behave himself
      rightly, and not to affront them. Solomon himself would be put to it, to
      make some of these authoresses unknown, avow or give up their own progeny.
      Their affectation is beyond the affectation of woman, and it makes all men
      sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others without affectation are only arrant cowards. They are afraid to
      stand exposed on their painful pre-eminence. Some from pure good-nature
      make themselves ridiculous; imagining that they are nine feet high at the
      least, shrink and distort themselves continually in condescension to our
      inferiority; or lest we should be blasted with excess of light, come into
      company shading their farthing candle&mdash;burning blue, pale, and faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noticed that the <i>bore condescending</i> is peculiarly
      obnoxious to the proud man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the <i>bore condescending</i>, who, whether good-natured or
      ill-natured, is a most provoking animal&mdash;there is the bore <i>facetious</i>,
      an insufferable creature, always laughing, but with whom you can never
      laugh. And there is another exotic variety&mdash;the <i>vive la bagatelle
      bore</i> of the ape kind&mdash;who imitate men of genius. Having early
      been taught that there is nothing more delightful than the unbending of a
      great mind, they set about continually to unbend the bow in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the spring and fall, the ebb and tide of genius, we have heard much
      from Milton, Dryden, and others. At ebb time&mdash;a time which must come
      to all, pretty or rich, treasures are discovered upon some shores; or
      golden sands are seen when the waters run low. In others bare rocks,
      slime, or reptiles. May I never be at low tide with a bore! Despising the
      Bagatelle, there is the serious regular conversation bore, who listens to
      himself, talks from notes, and is witty by rule. All rules for
      conversation were no doubt invented by bores, and if followed would make
      all men and women bores, either in straining to be witty, or striving to
      be easy. There is no more certain method, even for him who may possess the
      talent in the highest degree, to lose the power of conversing, than by
      talking to support his character. One eye to your reputation, one on the
      company, would never do, were it with the best of eyes. Few people are of
      Descartes' mind, that squinting is pretty. It has been said, that pleasure
      never comes, if you send her a formal card of invitation; to a <i>conversazione</i>
      certainly never; whatever she might to a dinner-party. Ease cannot stay,
      wit flies away, and humour grows dull, if people try for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well-bred persons, abhorring the pedantry of the blues, are usually <i>anti-blues</i>,
      or <i>ultra-antis</i>. But though there exists in a certain circle a
      natural honest aversion to every thing like wit or learning, is it
      absolutely certain that if taking thought won't do it, taking none will
      do? They are determined, they declare, to have easy conversation, or none.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let the ease be high-bred and silent as possible&mdash;let it be the
      repose of the Transcendental&mdash;the death-like silence of the Exclusive
      in the perfumed atmosphere of the Exquisite; then begins the danger of
      going to sleep&mdash;desperate danger. In these high circles are to be
      found, <i>apparently</i>, the most sleepy of all animated beings. <i>Apparently</i>,
      I say, because, on close observation, it will usually be found that, like
      the spider, who, from fear, counterfeits death, these, from pride,
      counterfeit sleep. They will sometimes pretend to be asleep for hours
      together, when any person or persons are near whom they do not choose to
      notice. They lie stretched on sofas, rolled up in shawls most part of the
      day, quite empty. At certain hours of the night, found congregated,
      sitting up dressed, on beds of roses, back to back, with eyes scarce open.
      They are observed to give sign of animation only on the approach of a blue&mdash;their
      antipathy. They then look at each other, and shrink. That the <i>sham-sleeping
      bore</i> is a delicate creature, I shall not dispute, but they are
      intolerably tiresome. For my own part, I would rather give up the honour
      and the elegance, and go to the antipodes at once, and live with their
      antagonists, the <i>lion-hunters</i>&mdash;yea, the <i>lion-loving</i>
      bores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their antipodes, did I say? that was going too far: even the most
      exaggerated ultra-anti-blues, upon occasion, forget themselves strangely,
      and have been seen to join the common herd in running after lions. But
      they differ from the <i>blue-lion-loving-bore</i> proper, by never
      treating the lion as if he were one of themselves. They follow and feed
      and fall down and worship the lion of the season; still, unless he be a
      nobleman, which but rarely occurs, he is never treated as a gentleman <i>quite</i>;
      there is always a difference made, better understood than described. I
      have heard lions of my acquaintance complain of showing themselves off to
      these <i>ultra-antis</i>, and have asked why they let themselves be made
      lions, if they disliked it so much, as no lion can well be led about, I
      should have conceived, quite against his will? I never could obtain any
      answer, but that indeed they could not help it; they were very sorry, but
      indeed they could not help being lions. And the polite lion-loving bore
      always echoed this, and addressed them with some such speech as the
      following:&mdash;"My dearest, sir, madam, or miss (as the case may be), I
      know, that of all things you detest being made a lion, and that you can't
      bear to be worshipped; yet, my dear sir, madam, or miss, you must let me
      kneel down and worship you, and then you must stand on your hind legs a
      little for me, only for one minute, my dear sir, and I really would not
      ask you to do it, only you are <i>such</i> a lion."
    </p>
    <p>
      But I have not yet regularly described the genus and species of which I am
      treating. The great lion-hunting bore, and the little lion-loving bore,
      male and female of both kinds; the male as eager as the female to fasten
      on the lion, and as expert in making the most of him, alive or dead, as
      seen in the finest example extant, Bozzy and Piozzi, fairly pitted; but
      the male beat the female hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common lion-hunting bore is too well known to need particular
      description; but some notice of their habitudes may not be useless for
      avoidance. The whole class male subsists by fetching and carrying bays,
      grasping at notes and scraps, if any great name be to them; run wild after
      verses in MS.; fond of autographs. The females carry albums; some learn <i>bon
      mots</i> by rote, and repeat them like parrots; others do not know a good
      thing when they meet with it, unless they are told the name of the cook.
      Some relish them really, but eat till they burst; others, after cramming
      to stupidity, would cram you from their pouch, as the monkey served
      Gulliver on the house-top. The whole tribe are foul feeders, at best love
      trash and fatten upon scraps; the worst absolutely rake the kennels, and
      prey on garbage. They stick with amazing tenacity, almost resembling
      canine fidelity and gratitude, to the remains of the dead lion. But in
      fact, their love is like that of the ghowl; worse than ghowls, they sell
      all which they do not destroy; every scrap of the dead lion may turn to
      account. It is wonderful what curious saleable articles they make of the
      parings of his claws, and hairs of his mane. The bear has been said to
      live at need by sucking his own paws. The bore lives by sucking the paws
      of the lion, on which he thrives apace, and, in some instances, has grown
      to an amazing size. The dead paws are as good for his purpose as the
      living, and better&mdash;there being no fear of the claws. How he escapes
      those claws when the lion is alive, is the wonder. The winged lion,
      however, is above touching these creatures; and the real gentleman lion of
      the true blood, in whose nature there is nothing of the bear, will never
      let his paws be touched by a bore. His hair stands on end at the approach
      or distant sight of any of the kind, lesser or greater; but very difficult
      he often finds it to avoid them. Any other may, more easily than a lion,
      <i>shirk a bore</i>. It is often attempted, but seldom or never
      successfully. He hides in his den, but <i>not at home</i> will not always
      do. The lion is too civil to shut the door in the bore's very face, though
      he mightily wishes to do so. It is pleasant sport to see a great bore and
      lion opposed to each other; how he stands or sits upon his guard; how
      cunningly the bore tries to fasten upon him, and how the lion tries to
      shake him off!&mdash;if the bore persists beyond endurance, the lion
      roars, and he flies; or the lion springs, and he dies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more extraordinary circumstance than any I have yet noted, respecting
      the natural history of lions and bores, remains to be told; that the lion
      himself, the <i>greater</i> kind as well as the lesser of him, are apt,
      sooner or later, to turn into bores; but the metamorphosis, though the
      same in the result, takes place in different circumstances, and from quite
      different causes: with the lesser lion and lioness often from being shown,
      or showing themselves too frequently; with the greater, from very fear of
      being like the animal he detests.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once knew a gentleman, not a bore quite, but a very clever man, one of
      great sensibility and excessive sensitiveness, who could never sit still a
      quarter of an hour together, never converse with you comfortably, or
      finish a good story, but evermore broke off in the middle with "I am <i>boring</i>
      you"&mdash;"I must run away or I shall be a bore." It ended in his
      becoming that which he most feared to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few rare exceptions to all that has been said of the caprices
      or <i>weaknesses</i> of lions. The greatest of lions known or unknown, the
      most agreeable as well as the noblest of creatures, is quite free from
      these infirmities. He neither affects to show himself, nor lies sullen in
      his den. I have somewhere seen his picture sketched; I should guess by
      himself at some moment I when the lion turned painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pique myself upon being one of the best conditioned animals that ever
      was shown, since the time of him who was in vain I defied by the knight of
      the woful figure; for I get up at the first touch of the pole, rouse
      myself, shake my mane, lick my chops, turn round, lie down, and go to
      sleep again." It was bad policy in me to let the words "<i>go to sleep</i>"
      sound upon the reader's ear, for I have not yet quite done; I have one
      more class, and though last not least; were I to adopt that enigmatical
      style which made the fortune of the oracle of Apollo, I might add&mdash;and
      though least, greatest. But this, the oracular sublime, has now gone to
      the gipsies and the conjurors, and I must write plain English, if I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am come to the crass of the <i>infant bore</i>&mdash;the <i>infant
      reciting bore</i>; seemingly insignificant, but exceedingly tiresome, also
      exceedingly dangerous, as I shall show. The old of this class we meet
      wherever we go&mdash;in the forum, the temple, the senate, the theatre,
      the drawing-room, the boudoir, the closet. The young infest our homes,
      pursue us to our very hearths; our household deities are in league with
      them; they destroy all our domestic comfort; they become public nuisances,
      widely destructive to our literature. Their mode of training will explain
      the nature of the danger. The infant reciting bore is trained much after
      the manner of a learned pig. Before the quadruped are placed, on certain
      bits of dirty greasy cards, the letters of the alphabet, or short
      nonsensical phrases interrogatory with their answers, such as "Who is the
      greatest rogue in company?" "Which lady or gentleman in company will be
      married first?" By the alternate use of blows and bribes of such food as
      pleases the pig, the animal is brought to obey certain signs from his
      master, and at his bidding to select any letter or phrase required from
      amongst those set before him, goes to his lessons, seems to read
      attentively, and to understand; then by a motion of his snout, or a
      well-timed grunt, designates the right phrase, and answers the
      expectations of his master and the company. The infant reciter is in
      similar manner trained by alternate blows and bribes, almonds and raisins,
      and bumpers of sweet wine. But mark the difference between him and the
      pig. Instead of greasy letters and old cards, which are used for the
      learned pig, before the little human animal are cast the finest morsels
      from our first authors, selections from our poets, didactic, pathetic, and
      sublime&mdash;every creature's best, sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are to be slowly but surely deprived of spirit, sense, and life, by
      the deadly deadening power of iteration. Not only are they deprived of
      life, but mangled by the infant bore&mdash;not only mangled, but polluted&mdash;left
      in such a state that no creature of any delicacy, taste, or feeling, can
      bear them afterwards. And are immortal works, or works which fond man
      thought and called immortal, thus to perish? Thus are they doomed to
      destruction, by a Lilliputian race of Vandals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curse of Minerva be on the heads of those who train, who incite them
      to such sacrilegious mischief! The mischief spreads every day wide and
      more wide. Till of late years, there had appeared bounds to its progress.
      Nature seemed to have provided against the devastations of the <i>infant
      reciter</i>. Formerly it seemed, that only those whom she had blessed or
      cursed with a wonderful memory, could be worth the trouble of training, or
      by the successful performance of the feats desired, to pay the labour of
      instruction. But there has arisen in the land, men who set at nought the
      decrees of nature, who undertake to make artificial memories, not only
      equal but superior to the best natural memory, and who, at the shortest
      notice, engage to supply the brainless with brains. By certain technical
      helps, long passages, whole poems, may now be learnt <i>by heart</i>, as
      they call it, without any aid, effort, or cognizance of the understanding;
      and retained and recited, under the same circumstances, by any irrational,
      as well and better, than by any rational being, if, to recite well, mean
      to repeat without missing a syllable. How far our literature may in future
      suffer from these blighting swarms, will best be conceived by a glance at
      what they have already withered and blasted of the favourite productions
      of our most popular poets, Gray, Goldsmith, Thomson, Pope, Dryden, Milton,
      Shakspeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope's Man of Ross was doomed to suffer first.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      "Rise, honest Muse, and sing the Man of Ross!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh, dreaded words! who is there that does not wish the honest muse should
      rise no more? Goldsmith came next, and shared the same fate. His country
      curate, the most amiable of men, we heard of till he grew past endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to learning any longer from the bee to build, or of the little nautilus
      to sail, we gave it up long ago. "To be or not to be"&mdash;is a question
      we can no longer bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Alexander's Feast&mdash;the little harpies have been at that too, and
      it is defiled. Poor Collins' Ode to the Passions, on and off the stage, is
      torn to very tatters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seven Ages of Man, and "All the world's a stage, and all the men and
      women in it"&mdash;gone to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality of mercy <i>is</i> strained, and is no longer twice blest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turn with disgust from "angels and ministers of grace." Adam's morning
      hymn has lost the freshness of its charm. The bores have got into Paradise&mdash;scaled
      Heaven itself! and defied all the powers of Milton's hell. Such Belials
      and Molochs as we have heard!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is absolutely shocking to perceive how immortal genius is in the power
      of mortal stupidity! Johnson, a champion of no mean force, stood forward
      in his day, and did what his single arm could do, to drive the little
      bores from the country church-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could not the pretty dears repeat together?" had, however, but a
      momentary effect. Though he knocked down the pair that had attempted to
      stand before him, they got up again, or one down, another came on. To this
      hour they are at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can be done against a race of beings not capable of being touched
      even by ridicule? What can we hope when the infant bore and his trainers
      have stood against the incomparable humour of "Thinks I to myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In time&mdash;and as certainly as the grub turns in due season into the
      winged plague who buzzes and fly-blows&mdash;the little reciting bore
      turns into the <i>dramatic</i> or <i>theatric</i> acting, reading,
      singing, recitative&mdash;and finally into the
      everlasting-quotation-loving bore&mdash;Greek, Latin, and English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The everlasting quotation-lover doats on the husks of learning. He is the
      infant reciting bore in second childishness. We wish in vain that it were
      in mere oblivion. From the ladies' tea-tables the Greek and Latin quoting
      bores were driven away long ago by the Guardian and the Spectator, and
      seldom now translate for the country gentlewomen. But the mere English
      quotation-dealer, a mortal tiresome creature! still prevails, and figures
      still in certain circles of old blues, who are civil enough still to
      admire that wonderful memory of his which has a quotation ready for every
      thing you can say&mdash;He usually prefaces or ends his quotations with&mdash;"As
      the poet happily says," or, "as Nature's sweetest woodlark justly
      remarks;" or, "as the immortal Milton has it."
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent the confusion and disgrace consequent upon such mistakes, and
      for the general advantage of literature, in reclaiming, if possible, what
      has gone to the bores, it might be a service to point out publicly such
      quotations as are now too common to be admitted within the pale of good
      taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last age, Lord Chesterfield set the mark of the beast, as he called
      it, on certain vulgarisms in pronunciation, which he succeeded in
      banishing from good company. I wish we could set the mark of the bore upon
      all which has been contaminated by his touch,&mdash;all those tainted
      beauties, which no person of taste would prize. They must be hung up
      viewless, for half a century at least, to bleach out their stains.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invite every true friend of literature and of good conversation, <i>blues</i>
      and <i>antis</i>, to contribute their assistance in furnishing out a list
      of quotations to be proscribed. Could I but accomplish this object, I
      should feel I had not written in vain. To make a good beginning, I will
      give half a dozen of the most notorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The light fantastic toe," has figured so long in the newspapers, that an
      editor of taste would hardly admit it now into his columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pity is akin to love,"&mdash;sunk to utter contempt; along with&mdash;"Grace
      is in all her steps;" and "Man never <i>is</i>, but always <i>to be blest</i>;"&mdash;"Youth
      at the prow, and pleasure at the helm;"&mdash;no longer safe on a boating
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bourgeois gentilhomme has talked prose too long without knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man is a hero to his <i>valet de chambre</i>,"&mdash;gone to the
      valets themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Le secret d'ennyer est celui de tout dire,"&mdash;in great danger of the
      same fate,&mdash;it is so tempting!&mdash;but, so much the worse,&mdash;wit
      is often its own worst enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some anatomists, it is said, have, during the operation of dissection,
      caught from the subject the disease. I feel myself in danger at this
      moment,&mdash;a secret horror thrills through my veins. Often have I
      remarked that persons who undergo certain transformations are unconscious
      of the commencement and progress in themselves, though quicksighted, when
      their enemies, friends, or neighbours, are beginning to turn into bores.
      Husband and wife,&mdash;no creatures sooner!&mdash;perceive each other's
      metamorphoses,&mdash;not Baucis and Philemon more surely, seldom like them
      before the transformation be complete. Are we in time to say the last
      adieu!
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel that I am&mdash;I fear that I have long been,

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "What! no music, no dancing at Castle Hermitage to-night; and all the
      ladies sitting in a formal circle, petrifying into perfect statues?" cried
      Sir Ulick O'Shane as he entered the drawing-room, between ten and eleven
      o'clock at night, accompanied by what he called his <i>rear-guard</i>,
      veterans of the old school of good fellows, who at those times in Ireland&mdash;times
      long since past&mdash;deemed it essential to health, happiness, and manly
      character, to swallow, and show themselves able to stand after swallowing,
      a certain number of bottles of claret per day or night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then," continued Sir Ulick, "of all the figures in nature or art,
      the formal circle is universally the most obnoxious to conversation, and,
      to me, the most formidable; all my faculties are spell-bound&mdash;here I
      am like a bird in a circle of chalk, that dare not move so much as its
      head or its eyes, and can't, for the life of it, take to its legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      A titter ran round that part of the circle where the young ladies sat&mdash;Sir
      Ulick was a favourite, and they rejoiced when he came among them; because,
      as they observed, "he always said something pleasant, or set something
      pleasant a-going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady O'Shane, for mercy's sake let us have no more of these permanent
      circle sittings at Castle Hermitage, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Ulick, I am sure I should be very glad if it were possible," replied
      Lady O'Shane, "to have no more <i>permanent sittings</i> at Castle
      Hermitage; but when gentlemen are at their bottle, I really don't know
      what the ladies can do but sit in a circle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't they dance in a circle, or any way? or have not they an elegant
      resource in their music? There's many here who, to my knowledge, can caper
      as well as they modulate," said Sir Ulick, "to say nothing of cards for
      those that like them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Annaly does not like cards," said Lady O'Shane, "and I could not ask
      any of these young ladies to waste their breath and their execution,
      singing and playing before the gentlemen came out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These young ladies would not, I'm sure, do us old fellows the honour of
      waiting for us; and the young beaux deserted to your tea-table a long hour
      ago&mdash;so why you have not been dancing is a mystery beyond my
      comprehension."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea or coffee, Sir Ulick O'Shane, for the third time of asking?" cried a
      sharp female voice from the remote tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't you swear to that being the voice of a presbyterian?" whispered
      Sir Ulick, over his shoulder to the curate: then aloud he replied to the
      lady, "Miss Black, you are three times too obliging. Neither tea nor
      coffee I'll take from you to-night, I thank you kindly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fortunate for yourself, sir&mdash;for both are as cold as stones&mdash;and
      no wonder!" said Miss Black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wonder!" echoed Lady O'Shane, looking at her watch, and sending forth
      an ostentatious sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What o'clock is it by your ladyship?" asked Miss Black. "I have a notion
      it's tremendously late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter&mdash;we are not pinned to hours in this house, Miss Black,"
      said Sir Ulick, walking up to the tea-table, and giving her a look, which
      said as plainly as look could say, "You had better be quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady O'Shane followed her husband, and putting her arm within his, began
      to say something in a fondling tone; and in a most conciliatory manner she
      went on talking to him for some moments. He looked absent, and replied
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take a cup of coffee from you now, Miss Black," said he, drawing
      away his arm from his wife, who looked much mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are too long, Lady O'Shane," added he, "standing here like lovers,
      talking to no one but ourselves&mdash;awkward in company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Like lovers!</i>" The sound pleased poor Lady O'Shane's ear, and she
      smiled for the first time this night&mdash;Lady O'Shane was perhaps the
      last woman in the room whom a stranger would have guessed to be Sir
      Ulick's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a fine gallant <i>off-hand</i> looking Irishman, with something of
      <i>dash</i> in his tone and air, which at first view might lead a common
      observer to pronounce him to be vulgar; but at five minutes after sight, a
      good judge of men and manners would have discovered in him the power of
      assuming whatever manner he chose, from the audacity of the callous
      profligate to the deference of the accomplished courtier&mdash;the
      capability of adapting his conversation to his company and his views,
      whether his object were "to set the senseless table in a roar," or to
      insinuate himself into the delicate female heart. Of this latter power,
      his age had diminished but not destroyed the influence. The fame of former
      conquests still operated in his favour, though he had long since passed
      his splendid meridian of gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Sir Ulick is drinking his cup of cold coffee, we may look back a
      little into his family history. To go no farther than his legitimate
      loves, he had successively won three wives, who had each, in her turn,
      been desperately enamoured: the first he loved, and married imprudently
      for love, at seventeen; the second he admired, and married prudently, for
      ambition, at thirty; the third he hated, but married, from necessity, for
      money, at five-and-forty. The first wife, Miss Annaly, after ten years'
      martyrdom of the heart, sank, childless,&mdash;a victim, it was said, to
      love and jealousy. The second wife, Lady Theodosia, struggled stoutly for
      power, backed by strong and high connexions; having, moreover, the
      advantage of being a mother, and mother of an only son and heir, the
      representative of a father in whom ambition had, by this time, become the
      ruling passion: the Lady Theodosia stood her ground, wrangling and
      wrestling through a fourteen years' wedlock, till at last, to Sir Ulick's
      great relief, not to say joy, her ladyship was carried off by a bad fever,
      or a worse apothecary. His present lady, formerly Mrs. Scraggs, a London
      widow of very large fortune, happened to see Sir Ulick when he went to
      present some address, or settle some point between the English and Irish
      government:&mdash;he was in deep mourning at the time, and the widow
      pitied him very much. But she was not the sort of woman he would ever have
      suspected could like him&mdash;she was a strict pattern lady, severe on
      the times, and, not unfrequently, lecturing young men gratis. Now Sir
      Ulick O'Shane was a sinner; how then could he please a saint? He did,
      however&mdash;but the saint did not please him&mdash;though she set to
      work for the good of his soul, and in her own person relaxed, to please
      his taste, even to the wearing of rouge and pearl-powder, and false hair,
      and false eyebrows, and all the falsifications which the <i>setters-up</i>
      could furnish. But after she had purchased all of youth which age can
      purchase for money, it would not do. The Widow Scraggs might, with her
      "lack lustre" eyes, have speculated for ever in vain upon Sir Ulick, but
      that, fortunately for her passion, at one and the same time, the Irish
      ministry were turned out, and an Irish canal burst. Sir Ulick losing his
      place by the change of ministry, and one half of his fortune by the canal,
      in which it had been sunk; and having spent in unsubstantial schemes and
      splendid living more than the other half; now, in desperate misery, laid
      hold of the Widow Scraggs. After a nine days' courtship she became a
      bride, and she and her plum in the stocks&mdash;but not her messuage,
      house, and lands, in Kent&mdash;became the property of Sir Ulick O'Shane.
      "Love was then lord of all" with her, and she was now to accompany Sir
      Ulick to Ireland. Late in life she was carried to a new country, and set
      down among a people whom she had all her previous days been taught to hold
      in contempt or aversion: she dreaded Irish disturbances much, and Irish
      dirt more; she was persuaded that nothing could be right, good, or
      genteel, that was not English. Her habits and tastes were immutably fixed.
      Her experience had been confined to a London life, and in proportion as
      her sphere of observation had been contracted, her disposition was
      intolerant. She made no allowance for the difference of opinion, customs,
      and situation, much less for the faults or foibles of people who were to
      her strangers and foreigners&mdash;her ladyship was therefore little
      likely to please or be pleased in her new situation. Her husband was the
      only individual, the only thing, animate or inanimate, that she liked in
      Ireland&mdash;and while she was desperately in love with an Irishman, she
      disliked Ireland and the Irish: even the Irish talents and virtues, their
      wit, humour, generosity of character, and freedom of manner, were lost
      upon her&mdash;her country neighbours were repelled by her air of taciturn
      self-sufficiency&mdash;and she, for her part, declared she would have been
      satisfied to have lived alone at Castle Hermitage with Sir Ulick. But Sir
      Ulick had no notion of living alone with her, or for any body. His habits
      were all social and convivial&mdash;he loved show and company: he had been
      all his life in the habit of entertaining all ranks of people at Castle
      Hermitage, from his excellency the Lord-Lieutenant and the
      commander-in-chief for the time being, to Tim the gauger, and honest Tom
      Kelly, the <i>stalko</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked of the necessity of keeping up a neighbourhood, and maintaining
      his interest in the county, as the first duties of man. Ostensibly Sir
      Ulick had no motive in all this, but the hospitable wish of seeing Castle
      Hermitage one continued scene of festivity; but under this good fellowship
      and apparent thoughtlessness and profusion, there was an eye to his own
      interest, and a keen view to the improvement of his fortune and the
      advancement of his family. With these habits and views, it was little
      likely that he should yield to the romantic, jealous, or economic tastes
      of his new lady&mdash;a bride ten years older than himself! Lady O'Shane
      was, soon after her arrival in Ireland, compelled to see her house as full
      of company as it could possibly hold; and her ladyship was condemned
      eternally, to do the honours to successive troops of <i>friends</i>, of
      whom she knew nothing, and of whom she disliked all she saw or heard. Her
      dear Sir Ulick was, or seemed, so engrossed by the business of pleasure,
      so taken up with his guests, that but a few minutes in the day could she
      ever obtain of his company. She saw herself surrounded by the young, the
      fair, and the gay, to whom Sir Ulick devoted his assiduous and gallant
      attentions; and though his age, and his being a married man, seemed to
      preclude, in the opinion of the cool or indifferent spectator, all idea of
      any real cause for jealousy, yet it was not so with poor Lady O'Shane's
      magnifying imagination. The demon of jealousy tortured her; and to enhance
      her sufferings, she was obliged to conceal them, lest they should become
      subjects of private mockery or public derision. It is the peculiar
      misfortune or punishment of misplaced, and yet more of unseasonable,
      passions, that in their distresses they obtain no sympathy; and while the
      passion is in all its consequence tragics to the sufferer, in all its
      exhibitions it is&mdash;ludicrous to the spectator. Lady O'Shane could not
      be young, and would not be old: so without the charms of youth, or the
      dignity of age, she could neither inspire love, nor command respect; nor
      could she find fit occupation or amusement, or solace or refuge, in any
      combination of company or class of society. Unluckily, as her judgment,
      never discriminating, was now blinded by jealousy, the two persons of all
      his family connexions upon whom she pitched as the peculiar objects of her
      fear and hatred were precisely those who were most disposed to pity and
      befriend her&mdash;to serve her in private with Sir Ulick, and to treat
      her with deference in public: these two persons were Lady Annaly and her
      daughter. Lady Annaly was a distant relation of Sir Ulick's first wife,
      during whose life some circumstances had occurred which had excited her
      ladyship's indignation against him. For many years all commerce between
      them had ceased. Lady Annaly was a woman of generous indignation, strong
      principles, and warm affections. Her rank, her high connexions, her high
      character, her having, from the time she was left a young and beautiful
      widow, devoted herself to the education and the interests of her children;
      her having persevered in her lofty course, superior to all the numerous
      temptations of love, vanity, or ambition, by which she was assailed; her
      long and able administration of a large property, during the minority of
      her son; her subsequent graceful resignation of power; his affection,
      gratitude, and deference for his mother, which now continued to prolong
      her influence, and exemplify her precepts in every act of his own;
      altogether placed this lady high in public consideration&mdash;high as any
      individual could stand in a country, where national enthusiastic
      attachment is ever excited by certain noble qualities congenial with the
      Irish nature. Sir Ulick O'Shane, sensible of the disadvantage of having
      estranged such a family connexion, and fully capable of appreciating the
      value of her friendship, had of late years taken infinite pains to redeem
      himself in Lady Annaly's opinion. His consummate address, aided and
      abetted and concealed as it was by his off-hand manner, would scarcely
      have succeeded, had it not been supported also by some substantial good
      qualities, especially by the natural candour and generosity of his
      disposition. In favour of the originally strong, and, through all his
      errors, wonderfully surviving taste for virtue, some of his manifold
      transgressions might be forgiven: there was much hope and promise of
      amendment; and besides, to state things just as they were, he had
      propitiated the mother, irresistibly, by his enthusiastic admiration of
      the daughter&mdash;so that Lady Annaly had at last consented to revisit
      Castle Hermitage. Her ladyship and her daughter were now on this
      reconciliation visit; Sir Ulick was extremely anxious to make it
      agreeable. Besides the credit of her friendship, he had other reasons for
      wishing to conciliate her: his son Marcus was just twenty&mdash;two years
      older than Miss Annaly&mdash;in course of time, Sir Ulick thought it might
      be a match&mdash;his son could not possibly make a better&mdash;beauty,
      fortune, family connexions, every thing that the hearts of young and old
      desire. Besides (for in Sir Ulick's calculations <i>besides</i> was a word
      frequently occurring), besides, Miss Annaly's brother was not as strong in
      body as in mind&mdash;in two illnesses his life had been despaired of&mdash;a
      third might carry him off&mdash;the estate would probably come to Miss
      Annaly. <i>Besides</i>, be this hereafter as it might, there was at this
      present time a considerable debt due by Sir Ulick to these Annalys, with
      accumulated interest, since the time of his first marriage; and this debt
      would be merged in Miss Annaly's portion, should she become his son's
      wife. All this was well calculated; but to say nothing of the character or
      affections of the son, Sir Ulick had omitted to consider Lady O'Shane, or
      he had taken it for granted that her love for him would induce her at once
      to enter into and second his views. It did not so happen. On the contrary,
      the dislike which Lady O'Shane took at sight to both the mother and
      daughter&mdash;to the daughter instinctively, at sight of her youth and
      beauty; to the mother reflectively, on account of her matronly dress and
      dignified deportment, in too striking contrast to her own frippery
      appearance&mdash;increased every day, and every hour, when she saw the
      attentions, the adoration, that Sir Ulick paid to Miss Annaly, and the
      deference and respect he showed to Lady Annaly, all for qualities and
      accomplishments in which Lady O'Shane was conscious that she was
      irremediably deficient. Sir Ulick thought to extinguish her jealousy, by
      opening to her his views on Miss Annaly for his son; but the jealousy,
      taking only a new direction, strengthened in its course. Lady O'Shane did
      not like her stepson&mdash;had indeed no great reason to like him; Marcus
      disliked her, and was at no pains to conceal his dislike. She dreaded the
      accession of domestic power and influence he would gain by such a
      marriage. She could not bear the thoughts of having a daughter-in-law
      brought into the house&mdash;placed in eternal comparison with her. Sir
      Ulick O'Shane was conscious that his marriage exposed him to some share of
      ridicule; but hitherto, except when his taste for raillery, and the
      diversion of exciting her causeless jealousy, interfered with his purpose,
      he had always treated her ladyship as he conceived that Lady O'Shane ought
      to be treated. Naturally good-natured, and habitually attentive to the
      sex, he had indeed kept up appearances better than could have been
      expected, from a man of his former habits, to a woman of her ladyship's
      present age; but if she now crossed his favourite scheme, it would be all
      over with her&mdash;her submission to his will had hitherto been a
      sufficient and a convenient proof, and the only proof he desired, of her
      love. Her ladyship's evil genius, in the shape of Miss Black, her humble
      companion, was now busily instigating her to be refractory. Miss Black had
      frequently whispered, that if Lady O'Shane would show more spirit, she
      would do better with Sir Ulick; that his late wife, Lady Theodosia, had
      ruled him, by showing proper spirit; that in particular, she should make a
      stand against the encroachments of Sir Ulick's son Marcus, and of his
      friend and companion, young Ormond. In consequence of these suggestions,
      Lady O'Shane had most judiciously thwarted both these young men in
      trifles, till she had become their aversion: this aversion Marcus felt
      more than he expressed, and Ormond expressed more strongly than he felt.
      To Sir Ulick, his son and heir was his first great object in life; yet,
      though in all things he preferred the interest of Marcus, he was not as
      fond of Marcus as he was of young Ormond. Young Ormond was the son of the
      friend of Sir Ulick O'Shane's youthful and warm-hearted days&mdash;the son
      of an officer who had served in the same regiment with him in his first
      campaign. Captain Ormond afterwards made an unfortunate marriage&mdash;that
      is, a marriage without a fortune&mdash;his friends would not see him or
      his wife&mdash;he was soon in debt, and in great distress. He was obliged
      to leave his wife and go to India. She had then one child at nurse in an
      Irish cabin. She died soon afterwards. Sir Ulick O'Shane took the child,
      that had been left at nurse, into his own house. From the time it was four
      years old, little Harry Ormond became his darling and grew up his
      favourite. Sir Ulick's fondness, however, had not extended to any care of
      his education&mdash;quite the contrary; he had done all he could to spoil
      him by the most injudicious indulgence, and by neglect of all instruction
      or discipline. Marcus had been sent to school and college; but Harry
      Ormond, meantime, had been let to run wild at home: the gamekeeper, the
      huntsman, and a cousin of Sir Ulick, who called himself the King of the
      Black Islands, had had the principal share in his education. Captain
      Ormond, his father, was not heard of for many years; and Sir Ulick always
      argued, that there was no use in giving Harry Ormond the education of an
      estated gentleman, when he was not likely to have an estate. Moreover, he
      prophesied that Harry would turn out the cleverest man of the two; and in
      the progress of the two boys towards manhood Sir Ulick had shown a strange
      sort of double and inconsistent vanity in his son's acquirements, and in
      the orphan Harry's natural genius. Harry's extremely warm, generous,
      grateful temper, delighted Sir Ulick; but he gloried in the superior
      polish of his own son. Harry Ormond grew up with all the faults that were
      incident to his natural violence of passions, and that might necessarily
      be expected from his neglected and deficient education. His devoted
      gratitude and attachment to his guardian father, as he called Sir Ulick,
      made him amenable in an instant, even in the height and tempest of his
      passions, to whatever Sir Ulick desired; but he was ungovernable by most
      other people, and rude even to insolence, where he felt tyranny or
      suspected meanness. Miss Black and he were always at open war; to Lady
      O'Shane he submitted, though with an ill grace; yet he did submit, for his
      guardian's sake, where he himself only was concerned; but most imprudently
      and fiercely he contended upon every occasion where Marcus, when
      aggrieved, had declined contending with his mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the present occasion the two youths had been long engaged to dine
      with, and keep the birthday of, Mr. Cornelius O'Shane, the King of the
      Black Islands&mdash;next to Sir Ulick the being upon earth to whom Harry
      Ormond thought himself most obliged, and to whom he felt himself most
      attached. This he had represented to Lady O'Shane, and had earnestly
      requested that, as the day for the intended dance was a matter of
      indifference to her, it might not be fixed on this day; but her ladyship
      had purposely made it a trial of strength, and had insisted upon their
      returning at a certain hour. She knew that Sir Ulick would be much vexed
      by their want of punctuality on this occasion, where the Annalys were
      concerned, though, in general, punctuality was a virtue for which he had
      no regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick had finished his cup of coffee. "Miss Black, send away the
      tea-things&mdash;send away all these things," cried he. "Young ladies,
      better late than never, you know&mdash;let's have dancing now; clear the
      decks for action."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies started from their seats immediately. All was now in
      happy motion. The servants answered promptly&mdash;the tea-things retired
      in haste&mdash;tables rolled away&mdash;chairs swung into the back-ground&mdash;the
      folding-doors of the dancing-room were thrown open&mdash;the pyramids of
      wax-candles in the chandeliers (for this was ere argands were on earth)
      started into light&mdash;the musicians tuning, screwing, scraping,
      sounded, discordant as they were, joyful notes of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where's my son&mdash;where's Marcus?" said Sir Ulick, drawing Lady
      O'Shane aside. "I don't see him any where."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Lady O'Shane; "you know that he would go to dine to-day with
      that strange cousin of yours, and neither he nor his companion have
      thought proper to return yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you had given me a hint," said Sir Ulick, "and I would have
      waited; for Marcus ought to lead off with Miss Annaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ought</i>&mdash;to be sure." said Lady O'Shane; "but that is no rule
      for young gentlemen's conduct. I told both the young gentlemen that we
      were to have a dance to-night. I mentioned the hour, and begged them to be
      punctual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young men are never punctual," said Sir Ulick; "but Marcus is inexcusable
      to-night on account of the Annalys."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick pondered for a moment with an air of vexation, then turning to
      the musicians, who were behind him, "You four-and-twenty fiddlers all in a
      row, you gentlemen musicians, scrape and tune on a little longer, if you
      please. Remember <i>you are not ready</i> till I draw on my gloves. Break
      a string or two, if necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will&mdash;we shall&mdash;plase your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish, Lady O'Shane," continued Sir Ulick in a lower tone, "I wish you
      had given me a hint of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truth to tell, Sir Ulick, I did, I own, conceive from your walk and way,
      that you were not in a condition to take any hint I could give."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw, my dear, after having known me, I won't say loved me, a calendar
      year, how can you be so deceived by outward appearances? Don't you know
      that I hate drinking? But when I have these county electioneering friends,
      the worthy red noses, to entertain, I suit myself to the company, by
      acting spirits instead of swallowing them, for I should scorn to appear to
      flinch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was true. Sir Ulick could, and often did, to the utmost perfection,
      counterfeit every degree of intoxication. He could act the rise, decline,
      and fall of the drunken man, marking the whole progress, from the first
      incipient hesitation of reason to the glorious confusion of ideas in the
      highest state of <i>elevation</i>, thence through all the declining cases
      of stultified paralytic ineptitude, down to the horizontal condition of
      preterpluperfect ebriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Sir Ulick, you are so good an actor that I don't pretend to judge&mdash;I
      can seldom find out the truth from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better for you, my dear, if you knew but all," said Sir
      Ulick, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I knew but all!" repeated her ladyship, with an alarmed look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's not the matter in hand at present, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick protracted the interval before the opening of the ball as long
      as he possibly could&mdash;but in vain&mdash;the young gentlemen did not
      appear. Sir Ulick drew on his gloves. The broken strings of the violins
      were immediately found to be mended. Sir Ulick opened the ball himself
      with Miss Annaly, after making as handsome an apology for his son as the
      case would admit&mdash;an apology which was received by the young lady
      with the most graceful good-nature. She declined dancing more than one
      dance, and Sir Ulick sat down between her and Lady Annaly, exerting all
      his powers of humour to divert them, at the expense of his cousin, the
      King of the Black Islands, whose tedious ferry, or whose claret, or more
      likely whose whiskey-punch, he was sure, had been the cause of Marcus's
      misdemeanour. It was now near twelve o'clock. Lady O'Shane, who had made
      many aggravating reflections upon the disrespectful conduct of the young
      gentlemen, grew restless on another <i>count</i>. The gates were left open
      for them&mdash;the gates ought to be locked! There were disturbances in
      the country. "Pshaw!" Sir Ulick said. Opposite directions were given at
      opposite doors to two servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dempsey, tell them they need not lock the gates till the young gentlemen
      come home, or at least till one o'clock," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stone," said Lady O'Shane to her own man in a very low voice, "go down
      directly, and see that the gates are locked, and bring me the keys."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dempsey, an Irishman, who was half drunk, forgot to see or say any thing
      about it. Stone, an Englishman, went directly to obey his lady's commands,
      and the gates were locked, and the keys brought to her ladyship, who put
      them immediately into her work-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards, as Lady O'Shane was sitting with her back to the
      glass-door of the green house, which opened into the ball-room, she was
      startled by a peremptory tap on the glass behind her; she turned, and saw
      young Ormond, pale as death, and stained with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The keys of the gate instantly," cried he, "for mercy's sake!"
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady O'Shane, extremely terrified, had scarcely power to rise. She opened
      the drawer of the table, and thrust her trembling hand down to the bottom
      of the silk bag, into which the keys had fallen. Impatient of delay,
      Ormond pushed open the door, snatched the keys, and disappeared. The whole
      passed in a few seconds. The music drowned the noise of the opening door,
      and of the two chairs, which Ormond had thrown down: those who sat near,
      thought a servant had pushed in and gone out; but, however rapid the
      movement, the full view of the figure had been seen by Miss Annaly, who
      was sitting on the opposite side of the room; Sir Ulick was sitting beside
      her, talking earnestly. Lady Annaly had just retired. "For Heaven's sake,
      what's the matter?" cried he, stopping in the middle of a sentence, on
      seeing Miss Annaly grow suddenly pale as death. Her eyes were fixed on the
      door of the green-house; his followed that direction. "Yes," said he, "we
      can get out into the air that way&mdash;lean on me." She did so&mdash;he
      pushed his way through the crowd at the bottom of the country dance; and,
      as he passed, was met by Lady O'Shane and Miss Black, both with faces of
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Ulick, did you see," pointing to the door, "did you see Mr. Ormond?&mdash;There's
      blood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's mischief, certainly," said Miss Black. "A quarrel&mdash;Mr.
      Marcus, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! No such thing, you'll find," said Sir Ulick, pushing on, and
      purposely jostling the arm of a servant who was holding a salver of ices,
      overturning them all; and whilst the surrounding company were fully
      occupied about their clothes, and their fears, and apologies, he made his
      way onwards to the green-house&mdash;Lady O'Shane clinging to one arm&mdash;Miss
      Annaly supported by the other&mdash;Miss Black following, repeating,
      "Mischief! mischief! you'll see, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Black, open the door, and not another word."
    </p>
    <p>
      He edged Miss Annaly on, the moment the door opened, dragged Lady O'Shane
      after him, pushed Miss Black back as she attempted to follow: but,
      recollecting that she might spread the report of mischief, if he left her
      behind, drew her into the green-house, locked the door, and led Miss
      Annaly out into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring salts! water! something, Miss Black&mdash;follow me, Lady O'Shane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I'm hardly able&mdash;your wife! Sir Ulick, you might," said Lady
      O'Shane, as she tottered on, "you might, I should have <i>thought</i>&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No time for such thoughts, my dear," interrupted he. "Sit down on the
      steps&mdash;there, she is better now&mdash;now what is all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not to speak," said Miss Black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady O'Shane began to say how Mr. Ormond had burst in, covered with blood,
      and seized the keys of the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The keys!" But he had no time for <i>that</i> thought. "Which way did he
      go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know; I gave him the keys of both gates."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two entrances were a mile asunder. Sir Ulick looked for footsteps on
      the grass. It was a fine moonlight night. He saw footsteps on the path
      leading to the gardener's house. "Stay here, ladies, and I will bring you
      intelligence as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This way, Sir Ulick&mdash;they are coming," said Miss Annaly, who had now
      recovered her presence of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several persons appeared from a turn in the shrubbery, carrying some one
      on a hand-barrow&mdash;a gentleman on horseback, with a servant and many
      persons walking. Sir Ulick hastened towards them; the gentleman on
      horseback spurred his horse and met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marcus!&mdash;is it you?&mdash;thank God! But Ormond&mdash;where is he,
      and what has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sound of Marcus's voice, when he attempted to answer, showed
      that he was not in a condition to give a rational account of any thing.
      His servant followed, also much intoxicated. While Sir Ulick had been
      stopped by their ineffectual attempts to explain, the people who were
      carrying the man on the hand-barrow came up. Ormond appeared from the
      midst of them. "Carry him on to the gardener's house," cried he, pointing
      the way, and coming forward to Sir Ulick. "If he dies, I am a murderer!"
      cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moriarty Carroll, please your honour," answered several voices at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how happened it?" said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The long and the short of it, sir," said Marcus, as well as he could
      articulate, "the fellow was insolent, and we cut him down&mdash;and if it
      were to do again, I'd do it again with pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! you won't say so, Marcus, when you are yourself," said Ormond.
      "Oh! how dreadful to come to one's senses all at once, as I did&mdash;the
      moment after I had fired that fatal shot&mdash;the moment I saw the poor
      fellow stagger and fall&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was you, then, that fired at him," interrupted Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, oh! yes!" said he, striking his forehead: "I did it in the fury of
      passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ormond, taking all the blame upon himself, and stating what had
      passed in the strongest light against himself, gave this account of the
      matter. After having drunk too much at Mr. Cornelius O'Shane's, they were
      returning from the Black Islands, and afraid of being late, they were
      galloping hard, when at a narrow part of the road they were stopped by
      some cars. Impatient of the delay, they abused the men who were driving
      them, insisting upon their getting out of the way faster than they could.
      Moriarty Carroll made some answer, which Marcus said was insolent; and
      inquiring the man's name, and hearing it was Carroll, said all the
      Carrolls were bad people&mdash;rebels. Moriarty defied him to prove <i>that</i>&mdash;and
      added some expressions about tyranny, which enraged Ormond. This part of
      the provocation Ormond did not state, but merely said he was thrown into a
      passion by some observation of Moriarty's; and first he lifted his whip to
      give the fellow a horsewhipping. Moriarty seized hold of the whip, and
      struggled to wrest it from his hand; Ormond then snatched a pistol from
      his holster, telling Moriarty he would shoot him, if he did not let the
      whip go. Moriarty, who was in a passion himself, struggled, still holding
      the whip. Ormond cocked the pistol, and before he was aware he had done
      so, the pistol accidentally went off&mdash;the ball entered Moriarty's
      breast. This happened within a quarter of a mile of Castle Hermitage. The
      poor fellow bled profusely; and, in assisting to lift him upon the
      hand-barrow, Ormond was covered with blood, as has been already described.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you sent for a surgeon?" said Sir Ulick, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;sent off a fellow on my own horse directly. Sir, will you
      come on to the gardener's house; I want you to see him, to know what
      you'll think. If he die, I am a murderer," repeated Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      This horrible idea so possessed his imagination, that he could not answer
      or hear any of the farther questions that were asked by Lady O'Shane and
      Miss Black; but after gazing upon them with unmeaning eyes for a moment in
      silence, walked rapidly on: as he was passing by the steps of the
      green-house, he stopped short at the sight of Miss Annaly, who was still
      sitting there. "What's the matter?" said he, in a tone of great
      compassion, going close up to her. Then, recollecting himself, he hurried
      forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I can be of no use&mdash;unless I can be of any use," said Miss
      Annaly, "I will, now that I am well enough, return&mdash;my mother will
      wonder what has become of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Ulick, give me the key of the conservatory, to let Miss Annaly into
      the ball-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Annaly does not wish to dance any more to-night, I believe," said
      Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dance&mdash;oh! no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, without exciting observation, you can all get in better at the back
      door of the house, and Miss Annaly can go up the back stairs to Lady
      Annaly's room, without meeting any one; and you, Lady O'Shane," added he,
      in a low voice, "order up supper, and say nothing of what has passed. Miss
      Black, you hear what I desire&mdash;no gossiping."
    </p>
    <p>
      To get to the back door they had to walk round the house, and in their way
      they passed the gardener's. The surgeon had just arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, ladies, pray," said Sir Ulick; "what stops you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis I stop the way, Sir Ulick," said Lady O'Shane, "to speak a word to
      the surgeon. If you find the man in any dangerous way, for pity's sake
      don't let him die at our gardener's&mdash;indeed, the bringing him here at
      all I think a very strange step and encroachment of Mr. Ormond's. It will
      make the whole thing so public&mdash;and the people hereabouts are so
      revengeful&mdash;if any thing should happen to him, it will be revenged on
      our whole family&mdash;on Sir Ulick in particular."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No danger&mdash;nonsense, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now this idea had seized Lady O'Shane, it appeared to her a sufficient
      reason for desiring to remove the man even this night. She asked why he
      could not be taken to his own home and his own people; she repeated, that
      it was very strange of Mr. Ormond to take such liberties, as if every
      thing about Castle Hermitage was quite at his disposal. One of the men who
      had carried the hand-barrow, and who was now standing at the gardener's
      door, observed, that Moriarty's <i>people</i> lived five miles off.
      Ormond, who had gone into the house to the wounded man, being told what
      Lady O'Shane was saying, came out; she repeated her words as he
      re-appeared. Naturally of sudden violent temper, and being now in the
      highest state of suspense and irritation, he broke out, forgetful of all
      proper respect. Miss Black, who was saying something in corroboration of
      Lady O'Shane's opinion, he first attacked, pronouncing her to be an
      unfeeling, <i>canting</i> hypocrite: then, turning to Lady O'Shane, he
      said that she might send the dying man away, if she pleased; but that if
      she did, he would go too, and that never while he existed would he enter
      her ladyship's doors again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond made this threat with the air of a superior to an inferior, totally
      forgetting his own dependent situation, and the dreadful circumstances in
      which he now stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are drunk, young man! My dear Ormond, you don't know what you are
      saying," interposed Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his voice, and the kindness of his tone, Ormond recollected himself.
      "Forgive me," said he, in a very gentle tone. "My head certainly is not&mdash;Oh!
      may you never feel what I have felt this last hour! If this man die&mdash;Oh!
      consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not die&mdash;he will not die, I hope&mdash;at any rate, don't
      talk so loud within hearing of these people. My dear Lady O'Shane, this
      foolish boy&mdash;this Harry Ormond is, I grant, a sad scapegrace, but you
      must bear with him for my sake. Let this poor wounded fellow remain here&mdash;I
      won't have him stirred to-night&mdash;we shall see what ought to be done
      in the morning. Ormond, you forgot yourself strangely towards Lady O'Shane&mdash;as
      to this fellow, don't make such a rout about the business; I dare say he
      will do very well: we shall hear what the surgeon says. At first I was
      horribly frightened&mdash;I thought you and Marcus had been quarrelling.
      Miss Annaly, are not you afraid of staying out? Lady O'Shane, why do you
      keep Miss Annaly? Let supper go up directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supper! ay, every thing goes on as usual," said Ormond, "and I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must follow them in, and see how things <i>are</i> going on, and
      prevent gossiping, for your sake, my boy," resumed Sir Ulick, after a
      moment's pause. "You have got into an ugly scrape. I pity you from my soul&mdash;I'm
      rash myself. Send the surgeon to me when he has seen the fellow. Depend
      upon me, if the worst come to the worst, there's nothing in the world I
      would not do to serve you," said Sir Ulick: "so keep up your spirits, my
      boy&mdash;we'll contrive to bring you through&mdash;at the worst, it will
      only be manslaughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond wrung Sir Ulick's hand&mdash;thanked him for his kindness; but
      repeated, "it will be murder&mdash;it will be murder&mdash;my own
      conscience tells me so! If he die, give me up to justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll think better of it before morning," said Sir Ulick, as he left
      Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon gave Ormond little comfort. After extracting the bullet, and
      examining the wound, he shook his head&mdash;he had but a bad opinion of
      the case; and when Ormond took him aside, and questioned him more closely,
      he confessed that he thought the man would not live&mdash;he should not be
      surprised if he died before morning. The surgeon was obliged to leave him
      to attend another patient; and Ormond, turning all the other people out of
      the room, declared he would sit up with Moriarty himself. A terrible night
      it was to him. To his alarmed and inexperienced eyes the danger seemed
      even greater than it really was, and several times he thought his patient
      expiring, when he was faint from loss of blood. The moments in which
      Ormond was occupied in assisting him were the least painful. It was when
      he had nothing left to do, when he had leisure to think, that he was most
      miserable; then the agony of suspense, and the horror of remorse, were
      felt, till feeling was exhausted; and he would sit motionless and
      stupified, till he was wakened again from this suspension of thought and
      feeling by some moan of the poor man, or some delirious startings. Toward
      morning the wounded man lay easier; and as Ormond was stooping over his
      bed to see whether he was asleep, Moriarty opened his eyes, and fixing
      them on Ormond, said, in broken sentences, but so as very distinctly to be
      understood, "Don't be in such trouble about the likes of me&mdash;I'll do
      very well, you'll see&mdash;and even suppose I wouldn't&mdash;not a friend
      I have shall ever prosecute&mdash;I'll charge 'em not&mdash;so be easy&mdash;for
      you're a good heart&mdash;and the pistol went off unknownst to you&mdash;I'm
      sure there was no malice&mdash;let that be your comfort. It might happen
      to any man, let alone gentleman&mdash;don't <i>take on</i> so. Only think
      of young Mr. Harry sitting up the night with me!&mdash;Oh! if you'd go now
      and settle yourself yonder on t'other bed, sir&mdash;I'd be a grate dale
      asier, and I don't doubt but I'd get a taste of sleep myself&mdash;while
      now wid you standing over or <i>forenent</i> me, I can't close an eye for
      thinking of you, Mr. Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond immediately threw himself upon the other bed, that he might relieve
      Moriarty's feelings. The good nature and generosity of this poor fellow
      increased Ormond's keen sense of remorse. As to sleeping, for him it was
      impossible; whenever his ideas began to fall into that sort of confusion
      which precedes sleep, suddenly he felt as if his heart were struck or
      twinged, and he started with the recollection that some dreadful thing had
      happened, and wakened to the sense of guilt and all its horrors. Moriarty
      now lying perfectly quiet and motionless, and Ormond not hearing him
      breathe, he was struck with the dread that he had breathed his last. A
      cold tremor came over Ormond&mdash;he rose in his bed, listening in acute
      agony, when to his relief he at last distinctly heard Moriarty breathing
      strongly, and soon afterwards (no music was ever so delightful to Ormond's
      ear) heard him begin to breathe loudly, as if asleep. The morning light
      dawned soon afterwards, and the crowing of a cock was heard, which Ormond
      feared might waken him; but the poor man slept soundly through all these
      usual noises: the heaving of the bed-clothes over his breast went on with
      uninterrupted regularity. The gardener and his wife softly opened the door
      of the room, to inquire how things were going on; Ormond pointed to the
      bed, and they nodded, and smiled, and beckoned to him to come out,
      whispering that a <i>taste</i> of the morning air would do him good. He
      suffered them to lead him out, for he was afraid of debating the point in
      the room with the sleeping patient. The good people of the house, who had
      known Harry Ormond from a child, and who were exceedingly fond of him, as
      all the poor people in the neighbourhood were, said every thing they could
      think of upon this occasion to comfort him, and reiterated about a hundred
      times their prophecies, that Moriarty would be as sound and <i>good</i> a
      man as ever in a fortnight's time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, when he'd take the soft sleep he couldn't but do well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then perceiving that Ormond listened to them only with faint attention,
      the wife whispered to her husband, "Come off to our work, Johnny&mdash;he'd
      like to be alone&mdash;he's not equal to listen to our talk yet&mdash;it's
      the surgeon must give him hope&mdash;and he'll soon be here, I trust."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to their work, and left Ormond standing in the porch. It was a
      fine morning&mdash;the birds were singing, and the smell of the
      honeysuckle with which the porch was covered, wafted by the fresh morning
      air, struck Ormond's senses, but struck him with melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every thing in nature is cheerful except myself! Every thing in this
      world going on just the same as it was yesterday&mdash;but all changed for
      me!&mdash;within a few short hours&mdash;by my own folly, my own madness!
      Every animal," thought he, as his attention was caught by the house dog,
      who was licking his hand, and as his eye fell upon the hen and chickens,
      who were feeding before the door, "every animal is happy&mdash;and
      innocent! But <i>if this man die&mdash;I shall be a murderer</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought, perpetually recurring, so oppressed him, that he stood
      motionless, till he was roused by the voice of Sir Ulick O'Shane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Harry Ormond, how is it with you, my boy?&mdash;The fellow's alive,
      I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alive&mdash;Thank Heaven!&mdash;yes; and asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give ye joy&mdash;it would have been an ugly thing&mdash;not but what we
      could have brought you through: I'd go through thick and thin, you know,
      for you, as if it were for my own son. But Lady O'Shane," said Sir Ulick,
      changing his tone, and with a face of great concern, "I must talk to you
      about her&mdash;I may as well speak now, since it must be said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid," said Ormond, "that I spoke too hastily last night: I beg
      your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, put <i>me</i> out of the question: you may do what you please
      with me&mdash;always could, from the time you were four years old; but,
      you know, the more I love any body, the more Lady O'Shane hates them. The
      fact is," continued Sir Ulick, rubbing his eyes, "that I have had a weary
      night of it&mdash;Lady O'Shane has been crying and whining in my ears. She
      says I encourage you in being insolent, and so forth: in short, she cannot
      endure you in the house any longer. I suspect that sour one" (Sir Ulick,
      among his intimates, always designated Miss Black in this manner) "<i>puts
      her up to it</i>. But I will not give up my own boy&mdash;I will take it
      with a high hand. Separations are foolish things, as foolish as marriages;
      but I'd sooner part with Lady O'Shane at once than let Harry Ormond think
      I'd forsake him, especially in awkward circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, Sir Ulick, is what Harry Ormond can never think of you. He would be
      the basest, the most suspicious, the most ungrateful&mdash;But I must not
      speak so loud," continued he, lowering his voice, "lest it should waken
      Moriarty." Sir Ulick drew him away from the door, for Ormond was cool
      enough at this moment to have common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear guardian-father, allow me still to call you by that name,"
      continued Ormond, "believe me, your kindness is too fully&mdash;innumerable
      instances of your affection now press upon me, so that&mdash;I can't
      express myself; but depend upon it, suspicion of your friendship is the
      last that could enter my mind: I trust, therefore, you will do me the same
      sort of justice, and never suppose me capable of ingratitude&mdash;though
      the time is come when we must <i>part</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond could hardly pronounce the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Part!" repeated Sir Ulick: "no, by all the saints, and all the devils in
      female form!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am resolved," said Ormond, "firmly resolved on one point&mdash;never to
      be a cause of unhappiness to one who has been the source of so much
      happiness to me: I will no more be an object of contention between you and
      Lady O'Shane. Give her up rather than me&mdash;Heaven forbid! I the cause
      of separation!&mdash;never&mdash;never! I am determined, let what will
      become of me, I will no more be an inmate of Castle Hermitage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears started into Ormond's eyes; Sir Ulick appeared much affected, and in
      a state of great embarrassment and indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not bear to think of it&mdash;he swore it must not be: then he
      gradually sunk to hoping it was not necessary, and proposing palliatives
      and half measures. Moriarty must be moved to-day&mdash;sent to his own
      friends. That point he had, for peace sake, conceded to her ladyship, he
      said; but he should expect, on her part, that after a proper, a decent
      apology from Ormond, things might still be accommodated and go on
      smoothly, if that meddling Miss Black would allow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short he managed so, that whilst he confirmed the young man in his
      resolution to quit Castle Hermitage, he threw all the blame on Lady
      O'Shane; Ormond never doubting the steadiness of Sir Ulick's affection,
      nor suspecting that he had any secret motive for wishing to get rid of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where can you go, my dear boy?&mdash;What will you do with yourself?&mdash;What
      will become of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind&mdash;never mind what becomes of me, my dear sir: I'll find
      means&mdash;I have the use of head and hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My cousin, Cornelius O'Shane, he is as fond of you almost as I am, and he
      is not cursed with a wife, and is blessed with a daughter," said Sir
      Ulick, with a sly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes," continued he, "I see it all now: you have ways and means&mdash;I
      no longer object&mdash;I'll write&mdash;no, you'd write better yourself to
      King Corny, for you are a greater favourite with his majesty than I am.
      Fare ye well&mdash;Heaven bless you! my boy," said Sir Ulick, with warm
      emphasis. "Remember, whenever you want supplies, Castle Hermitage is your
      bank&mdash;you know I have a bank at my back (Sir Ulick was joined in a
      banking-house)'&mdash;Castle Hermitage is your bank, and here's your
      quarter's allowance to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick put a purse into Ormond's hand, and left him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But is it natural, is it possible, that this Sir Ulick O'Shane could so
      easily part with Harry Ormond, and thus "whistle him down the wind to prey
      at fortune?" For Harry Ormond, surely, if for any creature living, Sir
      Ulick O'Shane's affection had shown itself disinterested and steady. When
      left a helpless infant, its mother dead, its father in India, he had taken
      the child from the nurse, who was too poor even to feed or clothe it as
      her own; and he had brought little Harry up at his castle with his own son&mdash;as
      his own son. He had been his darling&mdash;literally his spoiled child;
      nor had this fondness passed away with the prattling, playful graces of
      the child's first years&mdash;it had grown with its growth. Harry became
      Sir Ulick's favourite companion&mdash;hunting, shooting, carousing, as he
      had been his plaything during infancy. On no one occasion had Harry,
      violent and difficult to manage as he was to others, ever crossed Sir
      Ulick's will, or in any way incurred his displeasure. And now, suddenly,
      without any cause, except the aversion of a wife, whose aversions seldom
      troubled him in any great degree, is it natural that he should give up
      Harry Ormond, and suffer him to sacrifice himself in vain for the
      preservation of a conjugal peace, which Sir Ulick ought to have known
      could not by such a sacrifice be preserved? Is it possible that Sir Ulick
      should do this? Is it in human nature?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, in the nature of Sir Ulick O'Shane. Long use had brought him to this;
      though his affections, perhaps, were naturally warm, he had on many
      occasions in his life sacrificed them to his scheming imaginations.
      Necessity the necessity of his affairs, the consequences of his
      extravagance&mdash;had brought him to this: the first sacrifices had not
      been made without painful struggles; but by degrees his mind had hardened,
      and his warmth of heart had cooled. When he said or <i>swore</i> in the
      most cordial manner that he "would do any thing in the world to serve a
      friend," there was always a mental reservation of "any thing that does not
      hurt my own interest, or cross my schemes."
    </p>
    <p>
      And how could Harry Ormond hurt his interest, or cross his schemes? or how
      had Sir Ulick discovered this so suddenly? Miss Annaly's turning pale was
      the first cause of Sir Ulick's change of sentiments towards his young
      favourite. Afterwards, during the whole that passed, Sir Ulick had watched
      the impression made upon her&mdash;he had observed that it was not for
      Marcus O'Shane's safety that she was anxious; and he thought she had
      betrayed a secret attachment, the commencement of an attachment he thought
      it, of which she was perhaps herself unconscious. Were such an attachment
      to be confirmed, it would disappoint Sir Ulick's schemes: therefore, with
      the cool decision of a practised <i>schemer</i>, he determined directly to
      get rid of Ormond. He had no intention of parting with him for ever, but
      merely while the Annalys were at Castle Hermitage: till his scheme was
      brought to bear, he would leave Harry at the Black Islands, and he could,
      he thought, recal him from banishment, and force a reconciliation with
      Lady O'Shane, and reinstate him in favour, at pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it possible that Miss Annaly, such an amiable and elegant young
      lady as she is described to be, should feel any attachment, any
      predilection for such a young man as Ormond; ill-educated, unpolished,
      with a violent temper, which had brought him early into life into the
      dreadful situation in which he now stands? And at the moment when, covered
      with the blood of an innocent man, he stood before her, an object of
      disgust and horror; could any sentiment like love exist or arise in a
      well-principled mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly not. Sir Ulick's acquaintance with unprincipled women misled him
      completely in this instance, and deprived him of his usual power of
      discriminating character. Harry Ormond was uncommonly handsome; and though
      so young, had a finely-formed, manly, graceful figure; and his manner,
      whenever he spoke to women, was peculiarly prepossessing. These personal
      accomplishments, Sir Ulick thought, were quite sufficient to win any
      lady's heart&mdash;but Florence Annaly was not to be won by such means: no
      feeling of love for Mr. Ormond had ever touched her heart, nor even
      crossed her imagination; none under such circumstances could have arisen
      in her innocent and well-regulated mind. Sudden terror, and confused
      apprehension of evil, made her grow very pale at the sight of his bloody
      apparition at the window of the ball-room. Bodily weakness, for she was
      not at this time in strong health, must be her apology, if she need any,
      for the faintness and loss of presence of mind, which Sir Ulick construed
      into proofs of tender anxiety for the personal fate of this young man. In
      the scene that followed, horror of his crime, pity for the agony of his
      remorse, was what she felt&mdash;what she strongly expressed to her
      mother, the moment she reached her apartment that night: nor did her
      mother, who knew her thoroughly, ever for an instant suspect that in her
      emotion, there was a mixture of any sentiments but those which she
      expressed. Both mother and daughter were extremely shocked. They were also
      struck with regret at the idea, that a young man, in whom they had seen
      many instances of a generous, good disposition, of natural qualities and
      talents, which might have made him a useful, amiable, and admirable member
      of society, should be, thus early, a victim to his own undisciplined
      passion. During the preceding winter they had occasionally seen something
      of Ormond in Dublin. In the midst of the dissipated life which he led,
      upon one or two occasions, of which we cannot now stop to give an account,
      he had shown that he was capable of being a very different character from
      that which he had been made by bad education, bad example, and profligate
      indulgence, or shameful neglect on the part of his guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after Sir Ulick had left Ormond, the surgeon appeared, and a
      new train of emotions arose. He had no time to reflect on Sir Ulick's
      conduct. He felt hurried on rapidly, like one in a terrible dream. He
      returned with the surgeon to the wounded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty had wakened, much refreshed from his sleep, and the surgeon
      confessed that his patient was infinitely better than he had expected to
      find him. Moriarty evidently exerted himself as much as he possibly could
      to appear better, that he might calm Ormond's anxiety, who stood waiting,
      with looks that showed his implicit faith in the oracle, and feeling that
      his own fate depended upon the next words that should be uttered. Let no
      one scoff at his easy faith: at this time Ormond was very young, not yet
      nineteen, and had no experience, either of the probability, or of the
      fallacy of medical predictions. After looking very grave and very wise,
      and questioning and cross-questioning a proper time, the surgeon said it
      was impossible for him to pronounce any thing decidedly, till the patient
      should have passed another night; but that if the next night proved
      favourable, he might then venture to declare him out of immediate danger,
      and might then begin to hope that, with time and care, he would do well.
      With this opinion, guarded and dubious as it was, Ormond was delighted&mdash;his
      heart felt relieved of part of the heavy load by which it had been
      oppressed, and the surgeon was well feed from the purse which Sir Ulick
      had put into Ormond's hands. Ormond's next business was to send a <i>gossoon</i>
      with a letter to his friend the King of the Black Islands, to tell him all
      that had passed, and to request an asylum in his dominions. By the time he
      had finished and despatched his letter, it was eight o'clock in the
      morning; and he was afraid that before he could receive an answer, it
      might be too late in the day to carry a wounded man as far as the Black
      Islands: he therefore accepted the hospitable offer of the village
      school-mistress, to give him and his patient a lodging for that night.
      There was indeed no one in the place who would not have done as much for
      Master Harry. All were in astonishment and sorrow when they heard that he
      was going to leave the castle; and their hatred to Lady O'Shane would have
      known no bounds, had they learned that she was the cause of his <i>banishment</i>:
      but this he generously concealed, and forbade those of his followers or
      partisans, who had known any thing of what had passed, to repeat what they
      had heard. It was late in the day before Marcus rose; for he had to sleep
      off the effects of his last night's intemperance. He was in great
      astonishment when he learned that Ormond was really going away; and "could
      scarcely believe," as he said repeatedly, "that Harry was so mad, or such
      a fool. As to Moriarty, a few guineas would have settled the business, if
      no rout had been made about it. Sitting up all night with such a fellow,
      and being in such agonies about him&mdash;how absurd! What more could he
      have done, if he had shot a gentleman, or his best friend? But Harry
      Ormond was always in extremes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcus, though he had not a very clear recollection of the events of the
      preceding night, was conscious, however, that he had been much more to
      blame than Ormond had stated; he had a remembrance of having been very
      violent, and of having urged Ormond to chastise Moriarty. It was not the
      first time that Ormond had screened him from blame, by taking the whole
      upon himself. For this Marcus was grateful to a certain degree: he thought
      he was fond of Harry Ormond; but he had not for him the solid friendship
      that would stand the test of adversity, still less would it be capable of
      standing against any difference of party opinion. Marcus, though he
      appeared a mild, indolent youth, was violent where his prejudices were
      concerned. Instead of being governed by justice in his conduct towards his
      inferiors, he took strong dislikes, either upon false informations, or
      without sufficient examination of the facts: cringing and flattery easily
      won his favour; and, on the other hand, he resented any spirit of
      independence, or even the least contradiction, from an inferior. These
      defects in his temper appeared more and more in him every year. As he
      ceased to be a boy, and was called upon to act as a man, the consequences
      of his actions became of greater importance; but in acquiring more power,
      he did not acquire more reason, or greater command over himself. He was
      now provoked with Ormond for being so anxious about Moriarty Carroll,
      because he disliked the Carrolls, and especially Moriarty, for some slight
      cause not worth recording. He went to Ormond, and argued the matter with
      him, but in vain. Marcus resented this sturdiness, and they parted,
      displeased with each other. Though Marcus expressed in words much regret
      at his companion's adhering to the resolution of quitting his father's
      house, yet it might be doubted whether, at the end of the conference,
      these professions were entirely sincere, whatever they might have been at
      the beginning: he had not a large mind, and perhaps he was not sorry to
      get rid of a companion who had often rivalled him in his father's favour,
      and who might rival him where it was still more his ambition to please.
      The coldness of Marcus's manner at parting, and the little difficulty
      which he felt in the separation, gave exquisite pain to poor Ormond, who,
      though he was resolved to go, did wish to be regretted, especially by the
      companion, the friend of his childhood. The warmth of his guardian's
      manner had happily deceived him; and to the recollection of this he
      recurred for comfort at this moment, when his heart ached, and he was
      almost exhausted with the succession of the painful, violently painful,
      feelings of the last four-and-twenty hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gossoon who had been sent with the despatch to the King of the Black
      Islands did not return this day&mdash;disappointment upon disappointment.
      Moriarty, who had exerted himself too much, that he might appear better
      than he really was, suffered proportionably this night; and so did Ormond,
      who, never before having been with any person delirious from fever, was
      excessively alarmed. What he endured cannot be described: it was, however,
      happy for him that he was forced to bear it all&mdash;nothing less could
      have made a sufficient impression on his mind&mdash;nothing less could
      have been a sufficient warning to set a guard upon the violence of his
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the fever abated: about eight o'clock the patient sunk into
      a sound sleep; and Ormond, kneeling by his bedside, ardent in devotion as
      in all his sentiments, gave thanks to Heaven, prayed for Moriarty's
      perfect recovery, and vowed with the strongest adjurations that if he
      might be spared for this offence, if he might be saved from the horror of
      being a murderer, no passion, no provocation should ever, during the whole
      future course of his life, tempt him to lift his hand against a
      fellow-creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose from his knees, after making this prayer and this vow, he was
      surprised to see standing beside him Lady Annaly&mdash;she had made a sign
      to the sick man not to interrupt Ormond's devotion by any exclamation at
      her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be not disturbed&mdash;let me not feel that I embarrass you, Mr. Ormond,"
      said she: "I came here not to intrude upon your privacy. Be not ashamed,
      young gentleman," continued she, "that I should have witnessed feelings
      that do you honour, and that interest me in your future fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interest Lady Annaly in my future fate!&mdash;Is it possible!" exclaimed
      Ormond: "Is it possible that one of whom I stood so much in awe&mdash;one
      whom I thought so much too good, ever to bestow a thought on&mdash;such a
      one as I am&mdash;as I was, even before this fatal&mdash;" (his voice
      failed).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not fatal, I hope&mdash;I trust," said Lady Annaly: "this poor man's
      looks at this moment assure me that he is likely to do well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True for ye, my lady," said Moriarty, "I'll do my best, surely: I'd live
      through all, if possible, for his sake, let alone my mudther's, or
      shister's, or my own&mdash;'twould be too bad, after; all the trouble he
      got these two nights, to be dying at last, I and <i>hanting</i> him, may
      be, whether I would or no&mdash;for as to prosecuting, that would never be
      any way, if I died twenty times over. I sint off that word to my mudthier
      and shister, with my curse if they'd do <i>other</i>&mdash;and only that
      they were at the fair, and did not get the word, or the news of my little
      accident, they'd have been here long ago; and the minute they come, I'll
      swear 'em not to prosecute, or harbour a thought of revenge again' him,
      who had no malice again' me, no more than a child. And at another's
      bidding, more than his own, he drew the trigger, and the pistol went off
      unknownst, in a passion: so there's the case for you, my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Annaly, who was pleased with the poor fellow's simplicity and
      generosity in this tragi-comic statement of the case, inquired if she
      could in any way afford him assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank your ladyship, but Mr. Harry lets me want for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor ever will, while I have a farthing I can call my own," cried Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hope, Mr. Ormond," said Lady Annaly, smiling, "that when Moriarty&mdash;is
      not that his name?&mdash;regains his strength, to which he seems well
      inclined, you do not mean to make him miserable and good for nothing, by
      supporting him in idleness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he sha'n't, my lady&mdash;I would not let him be wasting his little
      substance on me. And did ye hear, my lady, how he is going to lave Castle
      Hermitage? Well, of all the surprises ever I got! It come upon me like a
      shot&mdash;<i>my shot</i> was nothing to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to insist upon Moriarty's submitting to be silent and
      quiet; for not having the fear of the surgeon before his eyes, and having
      got over his first awe of the lady, he was becoming too full of oratory
      and action. Lady Annaly took Ormond out with her, that she might speak to
      him of his own affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not, I hope, Mr. Ormond, ascribe it to idle curiosity, but to a
      wish to be of service, if I inquire what your future plans in life may
      be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had never formed any, distinctly. "He was not fit for any
      profession, except, perhaps, the army&mdash;he was too old for the navy&mdash;he
      was at present going, he believed, to the house of an old friend, a
      relation of Sir Ulick, Mr. Cornelius O'Shane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son, Sir Herbert Annaly, has an estate in this neighbourhood, at which
      he has never yet resided, but we are going there when we leave Castle
      Hermitage. I shall hope to see you at Annaly, when you have determined on
      your plans; perhaps you may show us how we can assist in forwarding them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," repeated Ormond, in unfeigned astonishment, "that your
      ladyship can be so very good, so condescending, to one who so little
      deserves it? But I <i>will</i> deserve it in future. If I get over this&mdash;interested
      in <i>my</i> future fate&mdash;Lady Annaly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew your father many years ago," said Lady Annaly; "and as his son, I
      might feel some interest for you; but I will tell you sincerely, that, on
      some occasions, when we met in Dublin, I perceived traits of goodness in
      you, which, on your own account, Mr. Ormond, have interested me in your
      fate. But fate is an unmeaning commonplace&mdash;worse than commonplace&mdash;word:
      it is a word that leads us to imagine that we are <i>fated</i> or doomed
      to certain fortunes or misfortunes in life. I have had a great deal of
      experience, and from all I have observed, it appears to me, that far the
      greatest part of our happiness or misery in life depends upon ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond stopped short, and listened with the eagerness of one of quick
      feeling and quick capacity, who seizes an idea that is new to him, and the
      truth and value of which he at once appreciates. For the first time in his
      life he heard good sense from the voice of benevolence&mdash;he anxiously
      desired that she should go on speaking, and stood in such an attitude of
      attentive deference as fully marked that wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment Lady O'Shane's footman came up with a message from his
      lady; her ladyship sent to let Lady Annaly know that breakfast was ready.
      Repeating her good wishes to Ormond she bade him adieu, while he was too
      much overpowered with his sense of gratitude to return her thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since there exists a being, and such a being, interested for me, I must
      be worth something&mdash;and I will make myself worth something more: I
      will begin from this moment, I am resolved, to improve; and who knows but
      in the end I may become every thing that is good? I don't want to be
      great."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this resolution was not steadily adhered to, though it was for a
      time counteracted by circumstances, it was never afterwards entirely
      forgotten. From this period, in consequence of the great and painful
      impression which had been suddenly made on his mind, and from a few words
      of sense and kindness spoken to him at a time when his heart was happily
      prepared to receive them, we may date the commencement of our hero's
      reformation and improvement&mdash;hero, we say; but certainly never man
      had more faults than Ormond had to correct, or to be corrected, before he
      could come up to the received idea of any description of hero. Most heroes
      are born perfect&mdash;so at least their biographers, or rather their
      panegyrists, would have us believe. Our hero is far from this happy lot;
      the readers of his story are in no danger of being wearied, at first
      setting out, with the list of his merits and accomplishments; nor will
      they be awed or discouraged by the exhibition of virtue above the common
      standard of humanity&mdash;beyond the hope of imitation. On the contrary,
      most people will comfort and bless themselves with the reflection, that
      they never were quite so foolish, nor quite so bad, as Harry Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the advantage of those who may wish to institute the comparison, his
      biographer, in writing the life of Ormond, deems it a point of honour to
      extenuate nothing; but to trace, with an impartial hand, not only every
      improvement and advance, but every deviation or retrograde movement.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Full of sudden zeal for his own improvement, Ormond sat down at the foot
      of a tree, determined to make a list of all his faults, and of all his
      good resolutions for the future. He took out his pencil, and began on the
      back of a letter the following resolutions, in a sad scrawling hand and
      incorrect style.
    </p>
    <h3>
      HARRY OSMOND'S GOOD RESOLUTIONS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Resolved 1st.&mdash;That I will never drink more than (<i>blank number</i>
      of) glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved 2ndly.&mdash;That I will cure myself of being passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved 3rdly.&mdash;That I will never keep low company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved.&mdash;That I am too fond of flattery&mdash;women's, especially,
      I like most. To cure myself of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ormond</i>. Here he was interrupted by the sight of a little gossoon,
      with a short stick tucked under his arm, who came pattering on bare-foot
      in a kind of pace indescribable to those who have never seen it&mdash;it
      was something as like walking or running as chanting is to speaking or
      singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The answer I am from the Black Islands, Master Harry; and would have been
      back wid you afore nightfall yesterday, only <i>he</i>&mdash;King Corny&mdash;was
      at the fair of Frisky&mdash;could not write till this morning any way&mdash;but
      has his service to ye, Master Harry, will be in it for ye by half after
      two with a bed and blanket for Moriarty, he bid me say on account he
      forgot to put it in the note. In the Sally Cove the boat will be there <i>abow</i>
      in the big lough, forenent the spot where the fir dale was cut last seraph
      by them rogues."
    </p>
    <p>
      The despatch from the King of the Black Islands was then produced from the
      messenger's bosom, and it ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Harry. What the mischief has come over Cousin Ulick to be banishing
      you from Castle Hermitage? But since he <i>conformed</i>, he was never the
      same man, especially since his last mis-marriage. But no use moralizing&mdash;he
      was always too much of a courtier for me. Come you to me, my dear boy, who
      is no courtier, and you'll be received and embraced with open arms&mdash;was
      I Briareus, the same way&mdash;Bring Moriarty Carroll (if that's his
      name), the boy you shot, which has given you so much concern&mdash;for
      which I like you the better&mdash;and honour that boy, who, living or
      dying, forbade to prosecute. Don't be surprised to see the roof the way it
      is:&mdash;since Tuesday I wedged it up bodily without stirring a stick:&mdash;you'll
      see it from the boat, standing three foot high above the walls, waiting
      while I'm building up to it&mdash;to get attics&mdash;which I shall for
      next to nothing&mdash;by my own contrivance. Meantime, good dry lodging,
      as usual, for all friends at the palace. <i>He</i> shall be well tended
      for you by Sheelah Dunshaughlin, the mother of Betty, worth a hundred of
      her! and we'll soon set him up again with the help of such a nurse, as
      well as ever, I'll engage; for I'm a bit of a doctor, you know, as well as
      every thing else. But don't let any other doctor, surgeon, or apothecary,
      be coming after him for your life&mdash;for none ever gets a permit to
      land, to my knowledge, on the Black Islands&mdash;to which I attribute,
      under Providence, to say nothing of my own skill in practice, the
      wonderful preservation of my people in health&mdash;that, and woodsorrell,
      and another secret or two not to be committed to paper in a hurry&mdash;all
      which I would not have written to you, but am in the gout since four this
      morning, held by the foot fast&mdash;else I'd not be writing, but would
      have gone every inch of the way for you myself in style, in lieu of
      sending, which is all I can now do, my six-oared boat, streamers flying,
      and piper playing like mad&mdash;for I would not have you be coming like a
      banished man, but in all glory, to Cornelius O'Shane, commonly called King
      <i>Corny</i>&mdash;but no <i>king</i> to you, only your hearty old
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven bless Cornelius O'Shane!" said Harry Ormond to himself, as he
      finished this letter. "King or no king, the most warm-hearted man on
      earth, let the other be who he will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then pressing this letter to his heart, he put it up carefully, and rising
      in haste, he dropped the list of his faults. That train of associations
      was completely broken, and for the present completely forgotten; nor was
      it likely to be soon renewed at the Black Islands, especially in the
      palace, where he was now going to take up his residence. Moriarty was laid
      on a bed; and was transported, with Ormond, in the six-oared boat,
      streamers flying, and piper playing, across the lake to the islands.
      Moriarty's head ached terribly, but he nevertheless enjoyed the playing of
      the pipes in his ear, because of the air of triumph it gave Master Harry,
      to go away in this grandeur, in the face of the country. King Corny
      ordered the discharge of twelve guns on his landing, which popped one
      after another gloriously&mdash;the <i>hospitable echoes</i>, as Moriarty
      called them, repeating the sound. A horse, decked with ribands, waited on
      the shore, with King Corny's compliments for <i>Prince</i> Harry, as the
      boy, who held the stirrup for Ormond to mount, said he was instructed to
      call him, and to proclaim him "<i>Prince Harry</i>" throughout the island,
      which he did by sound of horn, the whole way they proceeded to the palace&mdash;very
      much to the annoyance of the horse, but all for the greater glory of the
      prince, who managed his steed to the admiration of the shouting ragged
      multitude, and of his majesty, who sat in state in his gouty chair at the
      palace door. He had had himself rolled out to welcome the coming guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all that's princely," cried he, "then, that young Harry Ormond was
      intended for a prince, he sits ahorse so like myself; and that horse
      requires a master hand to manage him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gracious, cordial, fatherly welcome, with which he was received,
      delighted his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Welcome, prince, my adopted son, welcome to Corny <i>castle&mdash;palace</i>,
      I would have said, only for the constituted authorities of the
      post-office, that might take exceptions, and not be sending me my letters
      right. As I am neither bishop nor arch, I have, in their blind eyes or
      conceptions, no right&mdash;Lord help them!&mdash;to a temporal palace. Be
      that as it may, come you in with me, here into the big room&mdash;and see!
      there's the bed in the corner for your first object, my boy&mdash;your
      wounded chap; and I'll visit his wound, and fix it and him the first thing
      for ye, the minute he comes up."
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty pointed to a bed in the corner of a large apartment, whose
      beautiful painted ceiling and cornice, and fine chimney-piece with
      caryatides of white marble, ill accorded with the heaps of oats and corn,
      the thrashing cloth and flail, which lay on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is intended for a drawing-room, understand," said King Corny; "but
      till it is finished, I use it for a granary or a barn, when it would not
      be a barrack-room or hospital, which last is most useful at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this hospital Moriarty was carefully conveyed. Here, notwithstanding
      his gout, which affected only his feet, King Corny dressed Moriarty's
      wound with exquisite tenderness and skill; for he had actually acquired
      knowledge and address in many arts, with which none could have suspected
      him to have been in the least acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was soon announced, which was served up with such a strange mixture
      of profusion and carelessness, as showed that the attendants, who were
      numerous and ill-caparisoned, were not much used to gala-days. The crowd,
      who had accompanied Moriarty into the house, were admitted into the
      dining-room, where they stood round the king, prince, and Father Jos the
      priest, as the courtiers, during the king's supper at Versailles,
      surrounded the King of France. But these poor people were treated with
      more hospitality than were the courtiers of the French king; for as soon
      as the dishes were removed, their contents were generously distributed
      among the attendant multitude. The people blest both king and prince,
      "wishing them health and happiness long to <i>reign</i> over them;" and
      bowing suitably to his majesty the king, and to his reverence the priest,
      without standing upon the order of their going, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, Father Jos," said the king to the priest, "say grace, and draw
      close, and let me see you do justice to my claret, or the whiskey punch if
      you prefer; and you, Prince Harry, we will set to it regally as long as
      you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till tea-time," thought young Harry. "Till supper-time," thought Father
      Jos. "Till bed-time," thought King Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      At tea-time young Harry, in pursuance of his <i>resolution</i> the first,
      rose, but he was seized instantly, and held down to his chair. The royal
      command was laid upon him "to sit still and be a good fellow." Moreover
      the door was locked&mdash;so that there was no escape or retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning when he wakened with an aching head, he recollected with
      disgust the figure of Father Jos, and all the noisy mirth of the preceding
      night. Not without some self-contempt, he asked himself what had become of
      his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wounded boy was axing for you, Master Harry," said the girl, who came
      in to open the shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is he?" cried Harry, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is <i>but soberly</i>; [Footnote: But soberly&mdash;not very well, or
      in good spirits.] he got the night but middling; he concaits he could not
      sleep becaase he did not get a sight of your honour afore he'd settle&mdash;I
      tell him 'tis the change of beds, which always hinders a body to sleep the
      first night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of having totally forgotten the poor fellow&mdash;the contrast
      between this forgetfulness and the anxiety and contrition of the two
      preceding nights, actually surprised Ormond: he could hardly believe that
      he was one and the same person. Then came excuses to himself: "Gratitude&mdash;common
      civility&mdash;the peremptoriness of King Corny&mdash;his passionate
      temper, when opposed on this tender point&mdash;the locked door&mdash;and
      two to one: in short, there was an impossibility in the circumstances of
      doing otherwise than what he had done. But then the same impossibility&mdash;the
      same circumstances&mdash;might recur the next night, and the next, and so
      on: the peremptory temper of King Corny was not likely to alter, and the
      moral obligation of gratitude would continue the same; so that at nineteen
      was he to become, from complaisance, what his soul and body abhorred&mdash;an
      habitual drunkard? And what would become of Lady Annaly's interest in his
      fate or his improvement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two questions were not of equal importance, but our hero was at this
      time far from having any just proportion in his reasoning: it was well he
      reasoned at all. The argument as to the obligation of gratitude&mdash;the
      view he had taken of the never-ending nature of the evil, which must be
      the consequence of beginning with weak complaisance&mdash;above all, the
      <i>feeling</i> that he had so lost his reason as not only to forget
      Moriarty, but to have been again incapable of commanding his passions, if
      any thing had occurred to cross his temper, determined Ormond to make a
      firm resistance on the next occasion that should occur: it did occur the
      very next night. After a dinner given to his chief tenants and the <i>genteel</i>
      people of the islands&mdash;a dinner in honour and in introduction of his
      <i>adopted son</i>, King Corny gave a toast "to the Prince presumptive,"
      as he now styled him&mdash;a bumper toast. Soon afterwards he detected <i>daylight</i>
      in Harry's glass, and cursing it properly, he insisted on flowing bowls
      and full glasses. "What! are you Prince <i>presumptuous</i>?" cried he,
      with a half angry and astonished look. "Would you resist and contradict
      your father and king at his own table after dinner? Down with the glass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther and steady resistance changed the jesting tone and half angry look
      of King Corny into sullen silence, and a black portentous brow of serious
      displeasure. After a decent time of sitting, the bottle passing him
      without farther importunity, Ormond rose&mdash;it was a hard struggle; for
      in the face of his benefactor he saw reproach and rage bursting from every
      feature: still he moved on towards the door. He heard the words "sneaking
      off sober!&mdash;let him sneak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had his hand on the lock of the door&mdash;it was a bad lock, and
      opened with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's gratitude for you! No heart, after all&mdash;I mistook him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond turned back, and firmly standing and firmly speaking, he said, "You
      did not mistake me formerly, sir; but you mistake me now!&mdash;Sneaking!&mdash;Is
      there any man here, sober or drunk," continued be, impetuously approaching
      the table, and looking round full in every face,&mdash;"is there any man
      here dares to say so but yourself?&mdash;You, <i>you</i>, my benefactor,
      my friend; you have said it&mdash;think it you did not&mdash;you could
      not, but say it you may&mdash;<i>You</i> may say what you will to Harry
      Ormond, bound to you as he is&mdash;bound hand and foot and heart I&mdash;Trample
      on him as you will&mdash;<i>you</i> may. <i>No heart</i>! Oblige me,
      gentlemen, some of you," cried he, his anger rising and his eyes kindling
      as he spoke, "some of you gentlemen, if any of you think so, oblige me by
      saying so. No gratitude, sir!" turning from them, and addressing himself
      to the old man, who held an untasted glass of claret as he listened&mdash;"No
      gratitude! Have not I?&mdash;Try me, try me to the death&mdash;you have
      tried me to the quick of the heart, and I have borne it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could bear it no longer: he threw himself into the vacant chair, flung
      out his arms on the table, and laying his face down upon them, wept aloud.
      Cornelius O'Shane pushed the wine away. "I've wronged the boy grievously,"
      said he; and forgetting the gout, he rose from his chair, hobbled to him,
      and leaning over him, "Harry, 'tis I&mdash;look up, my own boy, and say
      you forgive me, or I'll never forgive myself. That's well," continued he,
      as Harry looked up and gave him his hand; "that's well!&mdash;you've taken
      the twinge out of my heart worse than the gout: not a drop of gall or
      malice in your nature, nor ever was, more than in the child unborn. But
      see, I'll tell you what you'll do now, Harry, to settle all things&mdash;and
      lest the fit should take me ever to be mad with you on this score again.
      You don't choose to drink more than's becoming?&mdash;Well, you'se right,
      and I'm wrong. 'Twould be a burning shame of me to make of you what I have
      made of myself. We must do only as well as we can. But I will ensure you
      against the future; and before we take another glass&mdash;there's the
      priest&mdash;and you, Tom Ferrally there, step you for my swearing book.
      Harry Ormond, you shall take an oath against drinking more glasses than
      you please evermore, and then you're safe from me. But stay&mdash;you are
      a heretic. Phoo! what am I saying? 'twas seeing the priest put that word
      <i>heretic</i> in my head&mdash;you're not a catholic, I mean. But an
      oath's an oath, taken before priest or parson&mdash;an oath, taken how you
      will, will operate. But stay, to make all easy, 'tis I'll take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Against drinking, you! King Corny!" said Father Jos, stopping his hand,
      "and in case of the gout in your stomach?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Against drinking! do you think I'd perjure myself? No! But against
      pressing <i>him</i> to it&mdash;I'll take my oath I'll never ask him to
      drink another glass more than he likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The oath was taken, and King Corny concluded the ceremony by observing
      that, after all, there was no character he despised more than that of a
      sot. But every gentleman knew that there was a wide and material
      difference betwixt a gentleman who was fond of his bottle, and that
      unfortunate being, an habitual drunkard. For his own part, it was his
      established rule never to go to bed without a proper quantity of liquor
      under his belt; but he defied the universe to say he was ever known to be
      drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a court where such ingenious casuistry prevailed, it was happy for our
      hero that an unqualifying oath now protected his resolution.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night our hero was wakened by a loud bellowing. It
      was only King Corny in a paroxysm of the gout. His majesty was naturally
      of a very impatient temper, and his maxims of philosophy encouraged him to
      the most unrestrained expression of his feelings&mdash;the maxims of his
      philosophy&mdash;for he had read, though in most desultory manner, and he
      had thought often deeply, and not seldom justly. The turns of his mind,
      and the questions he asked, were sometimes utterly unexpected. "Pray,
      now," said he to Harry, who stood beside his bed, "now that I've a
      moment's ease&mdash;did you ever hear of the Stoics that the bookmen talk
      of? and can you tell me what good any one of them ever got by making it a
      point to make no noise, when they'd be <i>punished</i> and racked with
      pains of body or mind? Why, I will tell you all they got&mdash;all they
      got was no pity: who would give them pity that did not require it? I could
      bleed to death in a bath, as well as the best of them, if I chose it; or
      chew a bullet if I set my teeth to it, with any man in a regiment&mdash;but
      where's the use? nature knows best, and she says <i>roar</i>!" And he
      roared&mdash;for another twinge seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature said <i>sleep</i>! several times this night to Harry, and to every
      body in the palace; but they did not sleep, they could not, while the
      roaring continued: so all had reason to rejoice, and Moriarty in
      particular, when his majesty's paroxysm was past. Harry was in a sound
      sleep at twelve o'clock the next day, when he was summoned into the royal
      presence. He found King Corny sitting at ease in his bed, and that bed
      strewed over with a variety of roots and leaves, weeds and plants. An old
      woman was hovering over the fire, stirring something in a black kettle.
      "Simples these&mdash;of wonderful unknown power," said King Corny to
      Harry, as he approached the bed; "and I'll engage you don't know the name
      even of the half of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry confessed his ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No shame for you&mdash;was you as wise as King Solomon himself, you might
      not know them, for he did not, nor couldn't, he that had never set his
      foot a grousing on an Irish bog. Sheelah, come you over, and say what's
      this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman now came to assist at this bed of botany, and with
      spectacles slipping off, and pushed on her nose continually, peered over
      each green thing, and named in Irish "every herb that sips the dew."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheelah was deeper in Irish lore than King Corny could pretend to be: but
      then he humbled her with the "black hellebore of the ancients," and he
      had, in an unaccountable manner, affected her imagination by talking of
      "that famous howl of narcotic poisons, which that great man Socrates drank
      off." Sheelah would interrupt herself in the middle of a sentence, and
      curtsy if she heard him pronounce the name of Socrates&mdash;and at the
      mention of the bowl, she would regularly sigh, and exclaim, "Lord save us!&mdash;But
      that was a wicked bowl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after a cast of her eyes up to heaven, and crossing herself on the
      forehead, she would take up her discourse at the word where she had left
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Corny set to work compounding plasters and embrocations, preparing
      all sorts of decoctions of roots and leaves, famous <i>through the country</i>.
      And while he directed and gesticulated from his bed, the old woman worked
      over the fire in obedience to his commands; sometimes, however, not with
      that "prompt and mute obedience," which the great require.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Moriarty that King Corny, not having the use of his
      nether limbs, could not attend even in his gouty chair to administer the
      medicines he had made, and to see them fairly swallowed. Sheelah, whose
      conscience was easy on this point, contented herself with giving him a
      strict charge to "take every bottle to the last drop." All she insisted
      upon for her own part was, that she must tie the charm round his neck and
      arm. She would fain have removed the dressings of the wound to substitute
      plasters of her own, over which she had pronounced certain prayers or
      incantations; but Moriarty, who had seized and held fast one good
      principle of surgery, that the air must never be let into the wound, held
      mainly to this maxim, and all Sheelah could obtain was permission to clap
      on her charmed plaster over the dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time, or, as King Corny triumphantly observed, in "a wonderful
      short period," Moriarty got quite well, long before the king's gout was
      cured, even with the assistance of the black hellebore of the ancients.
      King Corny was so well pleased with his patient for doing such credit to
      his medical skill, that he gave him and his family a cabin, and spot of
      land, in the islands&mdash;a cabin near the palace; and at Harry's request
      made him his wood-ranger and his gamekeeper&mdash;the one a lucrative
      place, the other a sinecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Harry&mdash;Prince Harry&mdash;was now looked up to as a person
      all-powerful with <i>the master</i>; and petitions and requests to speak
      for them, to speak just one word, came pouring from all sides: but however
      enviable his situation as favourite and prince presumptive might appear to
      others, it was not in all respects comfortable to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly, when a boy, in his visits to the Black Islands, he used to have
      a little companion of whom he was fond&mdash;Dora&mdash;Corny's daughter.
      Missing her much, he inquired from her father where she was gone, and when
      she was likely to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is gone off to the <i>continent</i>&mdash;to the continent of
      Ireland, that is; but not banished for any misdemeanour. You know," said
      King Corny, "'tis generally considered as a punishment in the Black
      Islands to be banished to Ireland. A threat of that kind, I find
      sufficient to bring the most refractory and ill-disposed of my subjects,
      if I had any of that description, to rason in the last resort; but to that
      ultimate law I have not recourse, except in extreme cases; I understand my
      business of king too well, to wear out either shame or fear; but you are
      no legislator yet, Prince Harry. So what was you asking me about Dora? She
      is only gone a trip to the continent, to her aunt's, by the mother's side,
      Miss O'Faley, that you never saw, to get the advantage of a
      dancing-master, which myself don't think she wants&mdash;a natural
      carriage, with native graces, being, in my unsophisticated opinion, worth
      all the dancing-master's positions, contortions, or drillings; but her
      aunt's of a contrary opinion, and the women say it is essential. So let
      'em put Dora in the stocks, and punish her as they will, she'll be the
      gladder to get free, and fly back from their continent to her own Black
      Islands, and to you and me&mdash;that is, to me&mdash;I ax your pardon,
      Harry Ormond; for you know, or I should tell you in time, she is engaged
      already to White Connal, of Glynn&mdash;from her birth. That engagement I
      made with the father over a bowl of punch&mdash;I promised&mdash;I'm
      afraid it was a foolish business&mdash;I promised if ever he, Old Connal,
      should have a son, and I should have a daughter, his son should marry my
      daughter. I promised, I say&mdash;I took my oath: and then Mrs. Connal
      that was, had, shortly after, not one son, but two&mdash;and twins they
      were: and I had&mdash;unluckily&mdash;ten years after, the daughter, which
      is Dora&mdash;and then as she could not marry both, the one twin was to be
      fixed on for her, and that was him they call White Connal&mdash;so there
      it was. Well, it was altogether a rash act! So you'll consider her as a
      married woman, though she is but a child&mdash;it was a rash act, between
      you and I&mdash;for Connal's not grown up a likely lad for the girl to
      fancy; but that's neither here nor there: no, my word is passed&mdash;when
      half drunk, may be&mdash;but no matter&mdash;it must be kept sober&mdash;drunk
      or sober, a gentleman must keep his word&mdash;<i> fortiori</i> a king&mdash;<i>
      fortiori</i> King Corny. See! was there this minute no such thing as
      parchment, deed, stamp, signature, or seal in the wide world, when once
      Corny has squeezed a friend's hand on a bargain, or a promise, 'tis fast,
      was it ever so much against me&mdash;'tis as strong to me as if I had
      squeezed all the lawyers' wax in the creation upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond admired the honourable sentiment; but was sorry there was any
      occasion for it&mdash;and he sighed; but it was a sigh of pity for Dora:
      not that he had ever seen White Connal, or known any thing of him&mdash;but
      <i>White Connal</i> did not sound well; and her father's avowal, that it
      had been a rash engagement, did not seem to promise happiness to Dora in
      this marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time he had been a boy, Harry Ormond had been in the habit of
      ferrying over to the Black Islands whenever Sir Ulick could spare him. The
      hunting and shooting, and the life of lawless freedom he led on the
      Islands, had been delightful. King Corny, who had the command not only of
      boats, and of guns, and of fishing-tackle, and of men, but of carpenters'
      tools, and of smiths' tools, and of a lathe, and of brass and ivory, and
      of all the things that the heart of boy could desire, had appeared to
      Harry, when he was a boy, the richest, the greatest, the happiest of men&mdash;the
      cleverest, too&mdash;the most ingenious: for King Corny had with his own
      hands made a violin and a rat-trap; and had made the best coat, and the
      best pair of shoes, and the best pair of boots, and the best hat; and had
      knit the best pair of stockings, and had made the best dunghill in his
      dominions; and had made a quarter of a yard of fine lace, and had painted
      a panorama. No wonder that King Corny had been looked up to, by the
      imagination of childhood, as "a personage high as human veneration could
      look."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, although our hero was still but a boy in many respects, yet in
      consequence of his slight commerce with the world, he had formed some
      comparisons, and made some reflections. He had heard, accidentally, the
      conversation of a few people of common sense, besides the sly, witty, and
      satirical remarks of Sir Ulick, upon <i>cousin Cornelius</i>; and it had
      occurred to Harry to question the utility and real grandeur of some of
      those things, which had struck his childish imagination. For example, he
      began to doubt whether it were worthy of a king or a gentleman to be his
      own shoemaker, hatter, and tailor; whether it were not better managed in
      society, where these things are performed by different tradesmen: still
      the things were wonderful, considering who made them, and under what
      disadvantages they were made: but Harry having now seen and compared
      Corny's violin with other violins, and having discovered that so much
      better could be had for money, with so much less trouble, his admiration
      had a little decreased. There were other points relative to external
      appearance, on which his eyes had been opened. In his boyish days, King
      Corny, going out to hunt with hounds and horn, followed with shouts by all
      who could ride, and all who could run, King Corny hallooing the dogs, and
      cheering the crowd, appeared to him the greatest, the happiest of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had since seen hunts in a very different style, and he could no
      longer admire the rabble rout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human creatures, especially young human creatures, are apt to swing
      suddenly from one extreme to the other, and utterly to despise that which
      they had extravagantly admired. From this propensity Ormond was in the
      present instance guarded by affection and gratitude. Through all the folly
      of his kingship, he saw that Cornelius O'Shane was not a person to be
      despised. He was indeed a man of great natural powers, both of body and
      mind&mdash;of inventive genius, energy, and perseverance, which might have
      attained the greatest objects; though from insufficient knowledge, and
      self-sufficient perversity, they had wasted themselves on absurd or
      trivial purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strong contrast between the characters of Sir Ulick and his
      cousin Cornelius O'Shane. They disliked and despised each other: differing
      as far in natural disposition as the subtle and the bold, their whole
      course through life, and the habits contracted during their progress, had
      widened the original difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one living in the world, and mixing continually with men of all ranks
      and character, had, by bending easily, and being all things to all men,
      won his courtier-way onwards and upwards to the possession of a seat in
      parliament, and the prospect of a peerage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, inhabiting a remote island, secluded from all men but those
      over whom he <i>reigned</i>, caring for no earthly consideration, and for
      no human opinion but his own, had <i>for</i> himself and <i>by</i>
      himself, hewed out his way to his own objects, and then rested, satisfied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord of himself, and all his (<i>little</i>) world his own."

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning, when Harry Ormond was out shooting, and King Corny, who had
      recovered tolerably from the gout, was reinstated in his arm-chair in the
      parlour, listening to Father Jos reading "The Dublin Evening Post," a
      gossoon, one of the runners of the castle, opened the door, and putting in
      his curly red head and bare feet, announced, <i>in all haste</i>, that <i>he
      "just seen</i> Sir Ulick O'Shane in the boat, crossing the lake for the
      Black Islands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, breathless blockhead! and what of that?" said King Corny&mdash;"did
      you never see a man in a boat before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, plase your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what is there extraordinary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing at all, plase your honour, only&mdash;thought your honour might
      like to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you thought wrong, for I neither like it, nor mislike it. I don't
      care a rush about the matter&mdash;so take yourself down stairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a long time," said the priest, as the gossoon closed the door after
      him, "'tis a longer time than he ought, since Sir Ulick O'Shane paid his
      respects here, even in the shape of a morning visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning visit!" repeated Mrs. Betty Dunshaughlin, the housekeeper, who
      entered the room, for she was a privileged person, and had <i>les grandes
      et les petites entres in this palace</i>"&mdash;Morning visit!&mdash;are
      you sure, Father Jos&mdash;are you clear he isn't come intending to stay
      dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, in the devil's name, Betty, does it signify?" said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the dinner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about it?" said Corny, proudly: "whether he comes, stays, or goes,
      I'll not have a scrap, or an iota of it changed," added he in a despotic
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Wheugh</i>.'" said Betty, "one would not like to have a dinner of
      scraps&mdash;for there's nothing else to-day for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then if there <i>is</i> nothing else, there <i>can</i> be nothing else,"
      said the priest, very philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when strangers come to dine, one would make a bit of an exertion, if
      one could," said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's his own fault to be a stranger," said Father Jos, watching his
      majesty's clouding countenance; then whispering to Betty, "that was a
      faulty string you touched upon, Mrs. Betty; and can't you make out your
      dinner without saying any thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A person may speak in this house, I suppose, besides the clergy, Father
      Jos," said Mrs. Betty, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then looking out of the window, she added, "He's half-way over the lake,
      and he'll make his own apologies good, I'll engage, when he comes in; for
      he knows how to speak for himself as well as any gentleman&mdash;and I
      don't doubt but he'll get my Micky made an exciseman, as he promised to;
      and sure he has a good right&mdash;Isn't he a cousin of King Corny's?
      wherefore I'd wish to have all things proper. So I'll step out and kill a
      couple of chickens&mdash;won't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kill what you please," said King Corny; "but without my warrant, nothing
      killed or unkilled shall come up to my table this day&mdash;and that's
      enough. No more reasoning&mdash;quit the subject and the room, Betty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty quitted the room; but every stair, as she descended to the kitchen,
      could bear witness that she did not quit the subject; and for an hour
      afterwards, she reasoned against the obstinacy and folly of man, and the
      chorus in the kitchen moralized, in conformity and commiseration&mdash;in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Father Jos, though he regretted the exertions which Mrs. Betty
      might discreetly have made in favour of a good dinner, was by no means, as
      he declared, a friend or <i>fauterer</i> of Sir Ulick O'Shane&mdash;how
      could he, when Sir Ulick had recanted?&mdash;The priest looked with horror
      upon the apostasy&mdash;the King with contempt upon the desertion of his
      party. "Was he sincere any way, I'd honour him," said Cornelius, "or
      forgive him; but, not to be ripping up old grievances when there's no
      occasion, can't forgive the way he is at this present double-dealing with
      poor Harry Ormond&mdash;cajoling the grateful heart, and shirking the
      orphan boy that he took upon him to patronise. Why there I thought nobly
      of him, and forgave him all his sins, for the generous protection he
      afforded the son of his friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had Captain Ormond, the father, no fortune?" asked the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a trifle of three hundred a year, and no provision for the education
      or maintenance of the boy. Ulick's fondness for him, more than all, showed
      him capable of the disinterested <i>touch</i>; but then to belie his own
      heart&mdash;to abandon him he bred a favourite, just when the boy wants
      him most&mdash;Oh! how could he? And all for what? To please the wife he
      hates: that can't be&mdash;that's only the ostensible&mdash;but what the
      raal rason is I can't guess. No matter&mdash;he'll soon tell us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us! Oh! no," said the priest, "he'll keep his own secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll let it out, I'll engage, trying to hide it," said Corny: "like all
      cunning people, he <i>woodcocks</i>&mdash;hides his head, and forgets his
      body can be seen. But hark! he is coming up. Tommy!" said he, turning to a
      little boy of five years old, Sheelah's grandchild, who was playing about
      in the room, "hand, me that whistle you're whistling with, till I see
      what's the matter with it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      King Corny seemed lost in examination of the whistle when Sir Ulick
      entered the room; and after receiving and seating him with proud courtesy,
      he again returned to the charge, blowing through the whistle, earnestly
      dividing his observation between Sir Ulick and little Tommy, and asking
      questions, by turns, about the whistle, and about all at Castle Hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's my boy? Where's Harry Ormond?" was the first leading question Sir
      Ulick asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry Ormond's out shooting, I believe, somewhere or somehow, taking his
      pleasure, as I hope he will long, and always as long as he likes it, at
      the Black Islands; at least as long as I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick branched off into hopes of his cousin Cornelius's living long,
      very long; and in general terms, that were intended to avoid committing
      himself, or pinning himself to any thing, he protested that he must not be
      robbed of his boy, that he had always, with good reason, been jealous of
      Harry's affection for King Corny, and that he could not consent to let his
      term of stay at the Black Islands be either as long as Harry himself
      should like, or during what he hoped would be the life of his cousin,
      Cornelius O'Shane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something wrong, still, in this whistle. Why, if you loved him
      so, did you let him go when you had him?" said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thought it necessary, for domestic reasons," replied Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Continental policy</i>, that is; what I never understood, nor never
      shall," said Corny. "But I don't inquire any farther. If you are satisfied
      with yourself, we are all satisfied, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, I cannot be satisfied without seeing Harry this morning, for
      I've a little business with him&mdash;will you have the goodness to send
      for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos, who, from the window, saw Harry's dog snuffing along the path
      to the wood, thought he could not be far from the house, and went to make
      inquiries; and now when Sir Ulick and King Corny were left alone together,
      a dialogue&mdash;a sort of single combat, without any object but to try
      each other's powers and temper&mdash;ensued between them; in which the one
      on the offensive came on with a tomahawk, and the other stood on the
      defensive parrying with a polished blade of Damascus; and sometimes, when
      the adversary was off his guard, making a sly cut at an exposed part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you so busy about?" said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mending the child's toy," said Cornelius. "A man must be doing something
      in this world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a man of your ingenuity! 'tis a pity it should be wasted, as I have
      often said, upon mere toys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toys of one sort or other we are all taken up with through life, from the
      cradle to the grave. By-the-bye, I give you joy of your baronetage. I hope
      they did not make you pay, now, too much in conscience for that poor tag
      of nobility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These things are not always matters of bargain and sale&mdash;mine was
      quite an unsolicited honour, a mark of approbation and acceptance of my
      poor services, and as such, gratifying;&mdash;as to the rest, believe me,
      it was not, if I must use so coarse an expression, <i>paid</i> for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not paid for&mdash;what, then, it's owing for? To be paid for still?
      Well, that's too hard, after all you've done for them. But some men have
      no manner of conscience. At least, I hope you paid the fees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fees, of course&mdash;but we shall never understand one another,"
      said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what will be the next title or string you look forward to, Ulysses,
      may I ask? Is it to be Baron Castle Hermitage, or to get a riband, or a
      garter, or a thistle, or what?&mdash;A thistle! What asses some men are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      What savages some men are, thought Sir Ulick: he walked to the window, and
      looking out, hoped that Harry Ormond would soon make his appearance. "You
      are doing, or undoing, a great deal here, cousin Cornelius, I see, as
      usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but what I am doing, stand or fall, will never be my undoing&mdash;I
      am no speculator. How do your silver mines go on, Sir Ulick? I hear all
      the silver mines in Ireland turn out to be lead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish they did," said Sir Ulick, "for then we could turn all our lead to
      gold. Those silver mines certainly did not pay&mdash;I've a notion you
      found the same with your reclaimed bog here, cousin Cornelius&mdash;I
      understand that after a short time it relapses, and is worse than ever,
      like most things pretending to be reclaimed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak for yourself, there, Sir Ulick," said Cornelius; "you ought to
      know, certainly, for some thirty years ago, I think you pretended to be a
      reclaimed rake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't remember it," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, and so would poor Emmy Annaly, if she was alive, which it's
      fortunate for her she is not (broken-hearted angel, if ever there was one,
      by wedlock! and the only one of the Annalys I ever liked)," said Cornelius
      to himself, in a low leisurely voice of soliloquy. Then resuming his
      conversation tone, and continuing his speech to Sir Ulick, "I say you
      pretended thirty years ago, I remember, to be a reformed rake, and looked
      mighty smooth and plausible&mdash;and promised fair that the improvement
      was solid, and was to last for ever and a day. But six months after
      marriage comes a relapse, and the reclaimed rake's worse than ever. Well,
      to be sure, that's in favour of your opinion against all things pretending
      to be reclaimed. But see, my poor bog, without promising so well, performs
      better; for it's six years, instead of six months, that I've seen no
      tendency to relapse. See, the <i>cattle</i> upon it speak for themselves;
      an honest calf won't lie for any man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you joy of the success of your improvements. I admire, too, your
      ploughing team and ploughing tackle," said Sir Ulick, with an ironical
      smile. "You don't go into any indiscreet expense for farming implements or
      prize cattle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Cornelius, "I don't prize the prize cattle; the best prize a
      man can get, and the only one worth having, is that which he must give
      himself, or not get, and of which he is the best judge at all sasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What prize, may I ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may ask, and I'll answer&mdash;the prize of <i>success</i>; and,
      success to myself, I have, it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And succeeding in all your ends by such noble means must be doubly
      gratifying&mdash;and is doubly commendable and surprising," said Sir
      Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask&mdash;for it's my turn now to play ignoramus&mdash;may I ask,
      what noble means excites this gratuitous commendation and surprise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I commend, in the first place, the economy of your ploughing tackle&mdash;hay
      ropes, hay traces, and hay halters&mdash;doubly useful and convenient for
      harness and food."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corny replied, "Some people I know, think the most expensive harness and
      tackle, and the most expensive ways of doing every thing, the best; but I
      don't know if that is the way for the poor to grow rich&mdash;it may be
      the way for the rich to grow poor: we are all poor people in the Black
      Islands, and I can't afford, or think it good policy, to give the example
      of extravagant new ways of doing old things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a pity you don't continue the old Irish style of ploughing by the
      tail," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is against humanity to brute <i>bastes</i>, which, without any
      sickening palaver of sentiment, I practise. Also, it's against an act of
      parliament, which I regard sometimes&mdash;that is, when I understand
      them; which, the way you parliament gentlemen draw them up, is not always
      particularly intelligible to plain common sense; and I have no lawyers
      here, thank Heaven! to consult: I am forced to be legislator, and lawyer,
      and ploughman, and all, you see, the best I can for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the window, and called to give some orders to the man, or, as he
      called him, the boy&mdash;a boy of sixty&mdash;who was ploughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your team, I see, is worthy of your tackle," pursued Sir Ulick&mdash;"A
      mule, a bull, and two lean horses. I pity the foremost poor devil of a
      horse, who must starve in the midst of plenty, while the horse, bull, and
      even mule, in a string behind him, are all plucking and <i>munging</i>
      away at their hay ropes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius joined in Sir Ulick's laugh, which shortened its duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis comical ploughing, I grant," said he, "but still, to my fancy, any
      thing's better and more profitable <i>nor</i> the tragi-comic ploughing
      you practise every sason in Dublin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, you and all your courtiers, ploughing the half acre [Footnote:
      Ploughing the half acre. The English reader will please to inquire the
      meaning of this phrase from any Irish courtier.] continually, pacing up
      and down that Castle-yard, while you're waiting in attendance there. Every
      one to his taste, but&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'If there's a man on earth I hate,
     Attendance and dependence be his fate.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      "After all, I have very good prospects in life," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, you've been always living on prospects; for my part, I'd rather have
      a mole-hill in possession than a mountain in prospect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cornelius, what are you doing here to the roof of your house?" said Sir
      Ulick, striking off to another subject. "What a vast deal of work you do
      contrive to cut out for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather cut it out for myself than have any body to cut it out for
      me," said Cornelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, this will require all your extraordinary ingenuity,
      cousin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll engage I'll make a good job of it, in my sense of the word,
      though not in yours; for I know, in your vocabulary, that's only a good
      job where you pocket money and do nothing; now my good jobs never bring me
      in a farthing, and give me a great deal to do into the bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't envy you such jobs, indeed," said Sir Ulick; "and are you sure
      that at last you make them good jobs in any acceptation of the term?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! a man's never sure of any thing in this world, but of being abused.
      But one comfort, my own conscience, for which I've a trifling respect,
      can't reproach me; since my jobs, good or bad, have cost my poor country
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this point Sir Ulick was particularly sore, for he had the character of
      being one of the greatest <i>jobbers</i> in Ireland. With a face of much
      political prudery, which he well knew how to assume, he began to exculpate
      himself. He confessed that much public money had passed through his hands;
      but he protested that none of it had stayed with him. No man, who had done
      so much for different administrations, had been so ill paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the deuce do you work for them, then? You won't tell me it's for love&mdash;Have
      you got any character by it?&mdash;if you haven't profit, what have you? I
      would not let them make me a dupe, or may be something worse, if I was
      you," said Cornelius, looking him full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Savage!" said Sir Ulick again to himself. The tomahawk was too much for
      him&mdash;Sir Ulick felt that it was fearful odds to stand fencing
      according to rule with one who would not scruple to gouge or scalp, if
      provoked. Sir Ulick now stood silent, smiling forced smiles, and looking
      on while Cornelius played quite at his ease with little Tommy, blew shrill
      blasts through the whistle, and boasted that he had made a good job of
      that whistle any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Ormond, to Sir Ulick's great relief, now appeared. Sir Ulick
      advanced to meet him with an air of cordial friendship, which brought the
      honest flush of pleasure and gratitude into the young man's face, who
      darted a quick look at Cornelius, as much as to say, "You see you were
      wrong&mdash;he is glad to see me&mdash;he is come to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius said nothing, but stroked the child's head, and seemed taken up
      entirely with him; Sir Ulick spoke of Lady O'Shane, and of his hopes that
      prepossessions were wearing off. "If Miss Black were out of the way,
      things would all go right; but she is one of the mighty good&mdash;too
      good ladies, who are always meddling with other people's business, and
      making mischief."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry, who hated her, that is, as much as he could hate any body, railed
      at her vehemently, saying more against her than he thought, and concluded
      by joining in Sir Ulick's wish for her departure from Castle Hermitage,
      but not with any view to his own return thither: on that point he was
      quite resolute and steady. He would never, he said, be the cause of
      mischief. Lady O'Shane did not like him&mdash;why, he did not know, and
      had no right to inquire&mdash;and was too proud to inquire, if he had a
      right. It was enough that her ladyship had proved to him her dislike, and
      refused him protection at his utmost need: he should never again sue for
      her hospitality. He declared that Sir Ulick should no more be disquieted
      by his being an inmate at Castle Hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick became more warm and eloquent in dissuading him from this
      resolution, the more he perceived that Ormond was positively fixed in his
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool looker-on all the time remarked this, and Cornelius was convinced
      that he had from the first been right in his own opinion, that Sir Ulick
      was "<i>shirking the boy</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where's Marcus, sir? would not he come with you to see us?" said
      Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marcus is gone off to England. He bid me give you his kindest love: he
      was hurried, and regretted he could not come to take leave of you; but he
      was obliged to go off with the Annalys, to escort her ladyship to England,
      where he will remain this year, I dare say. I am much concerned to say,
      that poor Lady Annaly and Miss Annaly&mdash;" Sir Ulick cleared his
      throat, and gave a suspicious look at Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      This glance at Harry, the moment Sir Ulick pronounced the words <i>Miss
      Annaly</i>, first directed aright the attention of Cornelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Annaly and Miss Annaly! are they ill? What's the matter, for
      Heaven's sake!" exclaimed Harry with great anxiety; but pronouncing both
      the ladies' names precisely in the same tone, and with the same freedom of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick took breath. "Neither of the ladies are ill&mdash;absolutely
      ill; but they have both been greatly shocked by accounts of young Annaly's
      sudden illness. It is feared an inflammation upon his lungs, brought on by
      violent cold&mdash;his mother and sister left us this morning&mdash;set
      off for England to him immediately. Lady Annaly thought of you, Harry, my
      boy&mdash;you must be a prodigious favourite&mdash;in the midst of all her
      affliction, and the hurry of this sudden departure, this morning: she gave
      me a letter for you, which I determined to deliver with my own hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, Sir Ulick, affecting to search for the letter among many
      in his pocket, studied with careless intermitting glances our young hero's
      countenance, and Cornelius O'Shane studied Sir Ulick's: Harry tore open
      the letter eagerly, and coloured a good deal when he saw the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no business here reading that boy's secrets in his face," cried
      Cornelius O'Shane, raising himself on his crutches&mdash;"I'll step out
      and look at my roof. Will you come, Sir Ulick, and see how the job goes
      on?" His crutch slipped as he stepped across the hearth&mdash;Harry ran to
      him: "Oh, sir, what are you doing? You are not able to walk yet without me&mdash;why
      are you going? Secrets did you say?" (The words recurred to his ear.) "I
      have no secrets&mdash;there's no secrets in this letter&mdash;it's only&mdash;the
      reason I looked foolish was that here's a list of my own faults, which I
      made like a fool, and dropped like a fool&mdash;but they could not have
      fallen into better or kinder hands than Lady Annaly's."
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered the letter and its enclosure to Cornelius and Sir Ulick.
      Cornelius drew back. "I don't want to see the list of your faults, man,"
      said he: "do you think I haven't them all by heart already? and as to the
      lady's letter, while you live never show a lady's letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick, without ceremony, took the letter, and in a moment satisfying
      his curiosity that it was merely a friendly note, returned it and the list
      of his faults to Harry, saying. "If it had been a young lady's letter, I
      am sure you would not have shown it to me, Harry, nor, of course, would I
      have looked at it. But I presumed that a letter from old Lady Annaly could
      only be, what I see it is, very edifying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Lady Annaly, is it?" cried Cornelius: "oh! then there's no
      indiscretion, young man, in the case. You might as well scruple about your
      mother's letter, if you had one; or your mother's-in-law, which, to be
      sure, you'll have, I hope, in due course of nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the words mother-in-law, a cloud passed over Sir Ulick's
      brow, not unnoticed by the shrewd Cornelius; but the cloud passed away
      quickly, after Sir Ulick had darted another reconnoitring glance on
      Harry's open unconscious countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All's safe," said Sir Ulick to himself, as he took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Woodcocked</i>! that he has&mdash;as I foresaw he would," cried King
      Corny, the moment his guest had departed. "<i>Woodcocked</i>! if ever man
      did, by all that's cunning!"

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      King Corny sat for some minutes after Sir Ulick's departure perfectly
      still and silent, leaning both hands and his chin on his crutch. Then,
      looking up at Harry, he exclaimed, "What a dupe you are! but I like you
      the better for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you like me the better, at all events," said Harry; "but I
      don't think I am a dupe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;if you <i>did</i>, you would not be one: so you don't see that
      it was and <i>is</i> Sir Ulick, and not her ladyship, that wanted and
      wants to get rid of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Harry did not see this, and would not be persuaded of it. He defended
      his guardian most warmly; he was certain of Sir Ulick's affection; he was
      sure Sir Ulick was incapable of acting with such duplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty repeated, at every pause, "You are a dupe; but I like you the
      better for it. And," added he, "you don't&mdash;blind buzzard! as your
      want of conceit makes you, for which I like you the better, too&mdash;you
      don't see the reason why he banished you from Castle Hermitage&mdash;you
      don't see that he is jealous of your rivalling that puppy, Marcus, his
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rivalling Marcus in what, or how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>With</i> whom? boy, is the question you should ask; and in that case
      the answer is&mdash;Dunce, can't you guess now?&mdash;Miss Annaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Annaly!" repeated Harry with genuine surprise, and with a quick
      sense of inferiority and humiliation. "Oh, sir, you would not be so
      ill-natured as to make a jest of me!&mdash;I know how ignorant, how
      uninformed, what a raw boy I am. Marcus has been educated like a
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More shame for his father that couldn't do the same by you when he was
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Marcus, sir&mdash;there ought to be a difference&mdash;Marcus is heir
      to a large fortune&mdash;I have nothing. Marcus may hope to marry whoever
      he pleases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, whoever he <i>pleases</i>; and who will that be, if women are of my
      mind?" muttered Corny. "I'll engage, if you had a mind to rival him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rival him! the thought of rivalling my friend never entered my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is he your friend?" said Cornelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, I don't know: he was my friend, and I loved him sincerely&mdash;warmly&mdash;he
      has cast me off&mdash;I shall never complain&mdash;never blame him
      directly or indirectly; but don't let me be accused or suspected unjustly&mdash;I
      never for one instant had the treachery, presumption, folly, or madness,
      to think of Miss Annaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor she of you, I suppose, you'll swear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor she of me! assuredly not, sir," said Harry, with surprise at the
      idea. "Do you consider what I am&mdash;and what she is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am glad they are gone to England out of the way!" said Cornelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry for that," said Harry; "for I have lost a kind friend in
      Lady Annaly&mdash;one who at least I might have hoped would have become my
      friend, if I had deserved it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Might have hoped!&mdash;would have become!</i>&mdash;That's a friend
      in the air, who may never be found on earth. <i>If you deserved it</i>!&mdash;Murder!&mdash;who
      knows how that might turn out&mdash;<i>if</i>&mdash;I don't like that kind
      of subjunctive mood tenure of a friend. Give me the good imperative mood,
      which I understand&mdash;be my friend&mdash;at once&mdash;or not at all&mdash;that's
      my mood. None of your <i>if</i> friends for me, setting out with a proviso
      and an excuse to be off; and may be when you'd call upon 'em at your
      utmost need, 'Oh! I said if you deserve it&mdash;Lie there like a dog.'
      Now, what kind of a friend is that? If Lady Annaly is that sort, no need
      to regret her. My compliments to her, and a good journey to England&mdash;Ireland
      well rid of her! and so are you, too, my boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dear sir, how you have worked yourself up into a passion against
      Lady Annaly for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not for nothing&mdash;I've good rason to dislike the woman. What
      business had she, because she's an old woman and you a young man, to set
      up preaching to you about your faults? I hate prachers, feminine gender,
      especially."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is no preacher, I assure you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you tell me that&mdash;was not her letter very <i>edifying?</i>
      Sir Ulick said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; it was very kind&mdash;will you read it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I won't; I never read an edifying letter in my life with my eyes
      open, nor never will&mdash;quite enough for me that impertinent list of
      your faults she enclosed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That list was my own, not hers, sir: I dropped it under a tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, drop it into the fire now, and no more about it. Pray, after all,
      Harry, for curiosity's sake, what faults have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear sir, I thought you told me you knew them by heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always forget what I learn by heart; put me in mind, and may be I'll
      recollect as you go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, in the first place, I am terribly passionate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Passionate! true; that is Moriarty you are thinking of; and I grant you,
      that had like to have been a sad job&mdash;you had a squeak for your life
      there, and I pitied you as if it had been myself; for I know what it is
      after one of them blind rages is over, and one opens one's eyes on the
      wrong one has done&mdash;and then such a cursed feel to be penitent in
      vain&mdash;for that sets no bones. You were blind drunk that night, and
      that was my fault; but my late vow has prevented the future, and
      Moriarty's better in the world than ever he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to your goodness, sir." "Oh! I wasn't thinking of my goodness&mdash;little
      enough that same; but to ease your conscience, it was certainly the
      luckiest turn ever happened him the shot he got, and so he says himself.
      Never think of that more in the way of penitence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the way of reformation though, I hope, I shall all my life," said
      Harry. "One comfort&mdash;I have never been in a passion since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, then, a rasonable passion's allowable: I wouldn't give a farthing
      for a man that couldn't be in a passion on a proper occasion. I'm
      passionate myself, rasonably passionate, and I like myself the better for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you said just now you often repented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! never mind what I said <i>just now</i>&mdash;mind what I'm saying
      now. Isn't a red heat that you can see, and that warms you, better than a
      white heat that blinds you? I'd rather a man would knock me down than
      stand smiling at me, as cousin Ulick did just now, when I know he could
      have kilt me; he is not passionate&mdash;he has the command of himself&mdash;every
      feature under the courtier's regimen of hypocrisy. Harry Ormond, don't set
      about to cure yourself of your natural passions&mdash;why, this is rank
      methodism, all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Methodism, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Methodism</i>, sir!&mdash;don't contradict or repeat me&mdash;methodism,
      that the woman has brought you to the brink of, and I warn you from it! I
      did not know till now that your Lady Annaly was such a methodist&mdash;no
      methodist shall ever darken my doors, or lighten them either, with their
      <i>new</i> lights. New lights! new nonsense!&mdash;for man, woman, or
      beast. But enough of this, and too much, Harry. Prince Harry, pull that
      bell a dozen times for me this minute, till they bring out my old horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was possible that any one could have come up stairs, the
      impatient monarch, pointing with his crutch, added, "Run to the head of
      the stairs, Prince Harry dear, and call and screech to them to make no
      delay; and I want you out with me; so get your horse, Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir&mdash;is it possible&mdash;are you able?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am able, sir, possible or not," cried King Corny, starting up on his
      crutches. "Don't stand talking to me of possibilities, when 'tis a friend
      I am going to serve, and that friend as dear as yourself. Aren't you at
      the head of the stairs yet? Must I go and fall down them myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent this catastrophe, our young hero ran immediately and ordered
      the horses: his majesty mounted, or rather was mounted, and they proceeded
      to one of the prettiest farms in the Black Islands. As they rode to it, he
      seemed pleased by Harry's admiring, as he could, with perfect truth, the
      beauty of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the land&mdash;which you are no judge of yet, but you will&mdash;is
      as good as it is pretty," said King Corny, "which I am glad of for your
      sake, Prince Harry; I won't have you, like that <i>donny</i> English
      prince or king, they nicknamed <i>Lackland</i>.&mdash;No: you sha'n't lack
      land while I have it to let or give. I called you prince&mdash;Prince of
      the Black Islands&mdash;and here's your principality. Call out my prime
      minister, Pat Moore. I sent him across the bog to meet us at Moriarty's.
      Here he is, and Moriarty along with him to welcome you. Patrick, give
      Prince Harry possession&mdash;with sod and twig. Here's the kay from my
      own hand, and I give you joy. Nay, don't deny me the pleasure&mdash;I've a
      right to it. No wrong to my daughter, if that's what you are thinking of&mdash;a
      clear improvement of my own,&mdash;and she will have enough without it.
      Besides, her betrothed White Connal is a fat grazier, who will make her as
      rich as a Jew; and any way she is as generous as a princess herself. But
      if it pains you so, and weighs you down, as I see it does, to be under any
      obligation&mdash;you shall be under none in life. You shall pay me rent
      for it, and you shall give it up whenever you please. Well! we'll settle
      that between ourselves," continued his majesty; "only take possession,
      that's all I ask. But I hope," added he, "before we've lived a year, or
      whatever time it is till you arrive at years of discretion, you'll know me
      well enough, and love me well enough, not to be so stiff about a trifle,
      that's nothing between friend and friend&mdash;let alone the joke of king
      and prince, dear Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gift of this <i>principality</i> proved a most pernicious, nearly a
      fatal, gift to the young prince. The generosity, the delicacy, with which
      it was made, a delicacy worthy of the most polished, and little to have
      been expected from the barbarian mock-monarch, so touched our young hero's
      heart, so subjected his grateful spirit to his benefactor, that he
      thenceforth not only felt bound to King Corny for life, but prone to deem
      every thing he did or thought, wisest, fittest, best.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was invested with his petty principality, it was expected of him
      to give a dinner and a dance to the island: so he f gave a dinner and a
      dance, and every body said he was a fine fellow, and had the spirit of a
      prince. "King Corny, God bless him! couldn't go astray in his choice of a
      favourite&mdash;long life to him and Prince Harry! and no doubt there'd be
      fine hunting, and shooting, and coursing continually. Well, was not it a
      happy thing for the islands, when Harry Ormond first set foot on them?
      From a boy 'twas <i>a</i>sy to see what a man he'd be. Long may he live to
      <i>reign</i> over us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The taste for vulgar praise grew by what it fed upon. Harry was in great
      danger of forgetting that he was too fond of flattery, and too fond of
      company&mdash;not the best. He excused himself to himself, by saying that
      companions of some kind or other he must have, and he was in a situation
      where good company was not to be had. Then Moriarty Carroll was
      gamekeeper, and Moriarty Carroll was always out hunting or shooting with
      him, and he was led by kind and good feelings to be more familiar and <i>free</i>
      with this man than he would have been with any other in the same rank of
      life. The poor fellow was ardently attached to him, and repeated, with
      delight, all the praises he heard of Master Harry, through <i>the Islands</i>.
      The love of popularity seized him&mdash;popularity on the lowest scale! To
      be popular among the unknown, unheard-of inhabitants of the Black Islands,&mdash;could
      this be an object to any man of common sense, any one who had lived in
      civilized society, and who had had any thing like the education of a
      gentleman? The fact, argue about it as you will&mdash;the fact was as is
      here stated; and let those who hear it with a disdainful smile recollect
      that whether in Paris, London, or the Black Islands, the mob are, in all
      essential points, pretty nearly the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened about this time that Betty Dunshaughlin was rummaging in her
      young lady's work-basket for some riband, "which she knew she might take,"
      to dress a cap that was to be hung upon a pole as a prize, to be danced
      for at the <i>pattern</i>, [Footnote: <i>Patron</i>, probably&mdash;an
      entertainment held in honour of the <i>patron</i> saint. A festive
      meeting, similar to a wake in England.] to be given next Monday at Ormond
      Vale, by Prince Harry. Prince Harry was now standing by, giving some
      instructions about the ordering of the entertainment; Betty, in the mean
      time, pursued her own object of the riband, and as she emptied the basket
      in haste, threw out a book, which Harry, though not much at this time
      addicted to reading, snatched impatiently, eager to know what book it was:
      it was one he had often heard of&mdash;often intended to read some time or
      other, but somehow or other he had never had time: and now he was in the
      greatest possible hurry, for the hounds were out. But when once he had
      opened the book, he could not shut it: he turned over page after page,
      peeped at the end, the beginning, and the middle, then back to the
      beginning; was diverted by the humour&mdash;every Irishman loves humour;
      delighted with the wit&mdash;what Irishman is not? And his curiosity was
      so much raised by the story, his interest and sympathy so excited for the
      hero, that he read on, standing for a quarter of an hour, fixed in the
      same position, while Betty held forth unheard, about cap, supper, and <i>pattern</i>.
      At last he carried off the book to his own room, that he might finish it
      in peace; nor did he ever stop till he came to the end of the volume. The
      story not finishing there, and breaking off in a most interesting part, he
      went in search of the next volume, but that was not to be found. His
      impatience was ravenous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy, Master Harry," cried Mrs. Betty, "don't eat one up! I know nothing
      at-all-at-all about the book, and I'm very sorry I tumbled it out of the
      basket. That's all there is of it to be had high or low&mdash;so don't be
      tormenting me any more out of my life for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      But having seized upon her, he refused to let her go, and protested that
      he would continue to be the torment of her life, till she should find the
      other volume. Betty, when her memory was thus racked, put her hand to her
      forehead, and recollected that in <i>the apple-room</i> there was a heap
      of old books. Harry possessed himself of the key of the apple-room, tossed
      over the heap of tattered mouldy books, and at last found the precious
      volume. He devoured it eagerly&mdash;nor was it forgotten as soon as
      finished. As the chief part of the entertainment depended on the
      characters, it did not fade from his imagination. He believed the story to
      be true, for it was constructed with unparalleled ingenuity, and developed
      with consummate art. The character which particularly interested him was
      that of the hero, the more peculiarly, because he saw, or fancied that he
      saw, a resemblance to his own; with some differences, to be sure&mdash;but
      young readers readily assimilate and identify themselves with any
      character, the leading points of which resemble their own, and in whose
      general feelings they sympathize. In some instances, Harry, as he read on,
      said to himself, "I would not&mdash;I could not have done so and so." But
      upon the whole, he was charmed by the character&mdash;that of a
      warm-hearted, generous, imprudent young man, with little education, no
      literature, governed more by feeling than by principle, never upon any
      occasion reasoning, but keeping right by happy moral instincts; or when
      going wrong, very wrong, forgiven easily by the reader and by his
      mistress, and rewarded at the last with all that love and fortune can
      bestow, in consideration of his being "a very fine fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Closing the book, Harry Ormond resolved to be what he admired&mdash;and,
      if possible, to shine forth an Irish Tom Jones. For this purpose he was
      not at all bound to be a moral gentleman, nor, as he conceived, to be a <i>gentleman</i>
      at all&mdash;not, at least, in the commencement of his career: he might
      become accomplished at any convenient period of his life, and become moral
      at the end of it, but he might begin by being an accomplished&mdash;blackguard.
      Blackguard is a harsh word; but what other will express the idea?
      Unluckily, the easiest points to be imitated in any character are not
      always the best; and where any latitude is given to conscience, or any
      precedents are allowed to the grosser passions for their justification,
      those are the points which are afterwards remembered and applied in
      practice, when the moral salvo sentences are forgotten, or are at best but
      of feeble countervailing effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock on Monday evening the cap&mdash;the prize cap, flaming with
      red ribands from the top of the pole, streamed to the summer air, and
      delighted the upturned eyes of assembled crowds upon the green below. The
      dance began, and our popular hero, the delight of all the nymphs, and the
      envy of all the swains, danced away with one of the prettiest, "smartest,"
      "most likely-looking" "lasses," that ever appeared at any former patron.
      She was a degree more refined in manner, and polished in appearance, than
      the fair of the Black Islands, for she came from the continent of Ireland&mdash;she
      had the advantage of having been sometimes at the big house at Castle
      Hermitage&mdash;she was the gardener's daughter&mdash;Peggy Sheridan&mdash;distinguished
      among her fellows by a nosegay, such as no other could have procured&mdash;distinguished
      more by her figure and her face than by her nosegay, and more by her air
      and motions, than even by her figure or her face: she stepped well, and
      stepped out&mdash;she danced an Irish jig to admiration, and she was not
      averse from admiration; village prudes, perhaps, might call her a village
      coquette; but let not this suggest a thought derogatory to the reputation
      of the lively Peggy. She was a well-behaved, well-meaning, innocent,
      industrious girl&mdash;a good daughter, a good sister, and more than one
      in the neighbourhood thought she would make a good wife. She had not only
      admirers, but suitors in abundance. Harry Ormond could not think of her as
      a wife, but he was evidently&mdash;more evidently this day than ever
      before&mdash;one of Peggy's admirers. His heart or his fancy was always
      warmly susceptible to the charms of beauty; and, never well guarded by
      prudence, he was now, with his head full of Tom Jones, prone to run into
      danger himself, and rashly ready to hurry on an innocent girl to her
      destruction. He was not without hopes of pleasing&mdash;what young man of
      nineteen or twenty is? He was not without chance of <i>success</i>, as it
      is called, with Peggy&mdash;what woman can be pronounced safe, who
      ventures to extend to a young lover the encouragement of coquettish
      smiles? Peggy said, "innocent smiles sure," "meaning nothing;" but they
      were interpreted to mean something: less would in his present dispositions
      have excited the hero who imitated Tom Jones to enterprise. Report says
      that, about this time, Harry Ormond was seen disguised in a slouched hat
      and <i>trusty</i> [Footnote: Great coat.], wandering about the grounds at
      Castle Hermitage. Some swear they saw him pretending to dig in the garden;
      and even under the gardener's windows, seeming to be nailing up jessamine.
      Some would not swear, but if they might trust their own eyes, they might
      verily believe, and <i>could</i>, only that they would not, take their
      oath to having seen him once cross the lake alone by moonlight. But
      without believing above half what the world says, candour obliges us to
      acknowledge, that there was some truth in these scandalous reports. He
      certainly pursued, most imprudently "pursued the chase of youth and
      beauty;" nor would he, we fear, have dropped the chase till Peggy was his
      prey, but that <i>fortunately</i>, in the full headlong career of passion,
      he was suddenly startled and stopped by coming in view of an obstacle that
      he could not overleap&mdash;a greater wrong than he had foreseen, at least
      a different wrong, and in a form that made his heart tremble. He reined in
      his passion, and stood appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first hurry of that passion he had seen nothing, heard nothing,
      understood nothing, but that Peggy was pretty, and that he was in love. It
      happened one evening that he, with a rose yet unfaded in his hand&mdash;a
      rose which he had snatched from Peggy Sheridan&mdash;took the path towards
      Moriarty Carroll's cottage. Moriarty, seeing him from afar, came out to
      meet him; but when he came within sight of the rose, Moriarty's pace
      slackened, and turning aside, he stepped out of the path, as if to let Mr.
      Ormond pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How now, Moriarty?" said Harry. But looking in his face, he saw the poor
      fellow pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you, Moriarty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pain I just took about my heart," said Moriarty, pressing both hands to
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor fellow!&mdash;Wait!&mdash;you'll be better just now, I hope,"
      said Ormond, laying his hand on Moriarty's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never be better of it, I fear," said Moriarty, withdrawing his
      shoulder; and giving a jealous glance at the rose, he turned his head away
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll thank your honour to go on, and leave me&mdash;I'll be better by
      myself. It is not to your honour, above all, that I can open my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      A suspicion of the truth now flashed across Ormond's mind&mdash;he was
      determined to know whether it was the truth or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not leave you, till I know what's the matter," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then none will know that till I die," said Moriarty; adding, after a
      little pause, "there's no knowing what's wrong withinside of a man till he
      is opened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But alive, Moriarty, if the heart is in the case only," said Ormond, "a
      man can open himself to a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, if he had a friend," said Moriarty. "I'll beg your honour to let me
      pass&mdash;I am able for it now&mdash;I am quite stout again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then if you are quite stout again, I shall want you to row me across the
      lake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not able for that, sir," replied Moriarty, pushing past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Ormond, catching hold of his arm, "aren't you able or willing
      to carry a note for me?" As he spoke, Ormond produced the note, and let
      him see the direction&mdash;to Peggy Sheridan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sooner stab me to the heart <i>again</i>," cried Moriarty, breaking from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sooner stab myself to the heart then," cried Ormond, tearing the note to
      bits. "Look, Moriarty: upon my honour, till this instant, I did not know
      you loved the girl&mdash;from this instant I'll think of her no more&mdash;never
      more will I see her, hear of her, till she be your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wife!" repeated Moriarty, joy illuminating, but fear as instantly
      darkening his countenance. "How will that be now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>will</i> be&mdash;it shall be&mdash;as happily as honourably.
      Listen to me, Moriarty&mdash;as honourably now as ever. Can you think me
      so wicked, so base, as to say, <i>wife</i>, if&mdash;no, passion might
      hurry me to a rash, but of a base action I'm incapable. Upon my soul, upon
      the sacred honour of a gentleman&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look!" continued Ormond, taking the rose from his breast; "this is the
      utmost that ever passed between us, and that was my fault: I snatched it,
      and thus&mdash;thus," cried he, tearing the rose to pieces, "I scatter it
      to the winds of heaven; and thus may all trace of past fancy and folly be
      blown from remembrance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" said Moriarty, watching the rose-leaves for an instant, as they
      flew and were scattered out of sight; then, as Ormond broke the stalk to
      pieces, and flung it from him, he asked, with a smile, "Is the pain about
      your heart gone now, Moriarty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, plase your honour, not gone; but a quite different&mdash;better&mdash;but
      worse. So strange with me&mdash;I can't speak rightly&mdash;for the
      pleasure has seized me stronger than the pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lean against me, poor fellow. Oh, if I had broken such a heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how wrong I was when I said that word I did!" said Moriarty. "I ask
      your honour, your dear honour's pardon on my knees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?&mdash;For what?&mdash;You have done no wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No:&mdash;but I said wrong&mdash;very wrong&mdash;when I said stab me to
      the heart <i>again</i>. Oh, that word <i>again</i>&mdash;it was very
      ungenerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noble fellow!" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night to your honour, kindly," said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How happy I am now!" said our young hero to himself, as he walked home,
      "which I never should have been if I had done this wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortunate escape!&mdash;yes: but when the escape is owing to good
      fortune, not to prudence&mdash;to good feeling, not to principle&mdash;there
      is no security for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond was steady to his promise toward Moriarty: to do him justice, he
      was more than this&mdash;he was generous, actively, perseveringly
      generous, in his conduct to him. With open heart, open purse, public
      overture, and private negotiation with the parents of Peggy Sheridan, he
      at last succeeded in accomplishing Moriarty's marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's biographer may well be allowed to make the most of his
      persevering generosity on this occasion, because no other scrap of good
      can be found, of which to make any thing in his favour, for several months
      to come. Whether Tom Jones was still too much, and Lady Annaly too little,
      in his head&mdash;whether it was that King Corny's example and precepts
      were not always edifying&mdash;whether this young man had been prepared by
      previous errors of example and education&mdash;or whether he fell into
      mischief because he had nothing else to do in these Black Islands; certain
      it is, that from the operation of some or all of these causes conjointly,
      he deteriorated sadly. He took to "vagrant courses," in which the muse
      forbears to follow him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is said that the Turks have a very convenient recording angel, who,
      without dropping a tear to blot out that which might be wished unsaid or
      undone, fairly shuts his eyes, and forbears to record whatever is said or
      done by man in three circumstances: when he is drunk, when he is in a
      passion, and while he is <i>under age</i>. What the <i>under age</i>, or
      what the years of discretion of a Turk may be, we do not at this moment
      recollect. We only know that our own hero is not yet twenty. Without being
      quite as accommodating as the Mahometan angel, we should wish to
      obliterate from our record some months of Ormond's existence. He felt and
      was ashamed of his own degradation; but, after having lost, or worse than
      lost, a winter of his life, it was in vain to lament; or rather, it was
      not enough to weep over the loss&mdash;how to repair it was the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Ormond returned to his better self, whenever he thought of
      improving, he remembered Lady Annaly; and he now recollected with shame,
      that he had never had the grace to answer or to thank her for her letter.
      He had often thought of writing, but he had put it off from day to day,
      and now months had passed; he wrote a sad scrawling hand, and he had
      always been ashamed that Lady Annaly should see it; but now the larger
      shame got the better of the lesser, and he determined he would write. He
      looked for her letter, to read it over again before he answered it&mdash;the
      letter was very safe, for he considered it as his greatest treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On recurring to the letter, he found that she had mentioned a present of
      books which she intended for him: a set of books which belonged to her
      son, Sir Herbert Annaly, and of which she found they had duplicates in
      their library. She had ordered the box containing them to be sent to
      Annaly, and had desired her agent there to forward it; but in case any
      delay should occur, she begged Mr. Ormond would take the trouble to
      inquire for them himself. This whole affair about the books had escaped
      Ormond's memory: he felt himself blush all over when he read the letter
      again; and sent off a messenger immediately to the agent at Annaly, who
      had kept the box till it was inquired for. It was too heavy for the boy to
      carry, and he returned, saying that two men would not carry it, nor four&mdash;a
      slight exaggeration! A car was sent for it, and at last Harry obtained
      possession of the books. It was an excellent collection of what may be
      called the English and French classics: the French books were, at this
      time, quite useless to him, for he could not read French. Lady Annaly,
      however, sent these books on purpose to induce him to learn a language,
      which, if he should go into the army, as he seemed inclined to do, would
      be particularly useful to him. Lady Annaly observed that Mr. Ormond,
      wherever he might be in Ireland, would probably find even the priest of
      the parish a person who could assist him sufficiently in learning French;
      as most of the Irish parish priests were, at that time, educated at St.
      Omer's or Louvain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos had been at St. Omer's, and Harry resolved to attack him with a
      French grammar and dictionary; but the French that Father Jos had learnt
      at St. Omer's was merely from ear&mdash;he could not bear the sight of a
      French grammar. Harry was obliged to work on by himself. He again put off
      writing to thank Lady Annaly, till he could tell her that he had obeyed
      her commands; and that he could read at least a page of Gil Blas. Before
      this was accomplished, he learnt from the agent that Lady Annaly was in
      great affliction about her son, who had broken a blood-vessel. He could
      not think of intruding upon her at such a time&mdash;and, in short, he put
      it off till it seemed too late to write at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the English books was one in many volumes, which did not seize his
      attention forcibly, like Tom Jones, at once, but which won upon him by
      degrees, drew him on against his will, and against his taste. He hated
      moralizing and reflections; and there was here an abundance both of
      reflections and morality; these he skipped over, however, and went on. The
      hero and the heroine too were of a stiff fashion, which did not suit his
      taste; yet still there was something in the book that, in spite of the
      terrible array of <i>good people</i>, captivated his attention. The
      heroine's perpetual egotism disgusted him&mdash;she was always too good
      and too full of herself&mdash;and she wrote dreadfully long letters. The
      hero's dress and manner were too splendid, too formal, for every day use:
      at first he detested Sir Charles Grandison, who was so different from the
      friends he loved in real life, or the heroes he had admired in books; just
      as in old portraits, we are at first struck with the costume, but soon, if
      the picture be really by a master hand, our attention is fixed on the
      expression of the features and the life of the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensible as Ormond was of the power of humour and ridicule, he was still
      more susceptible, as all noble natures are, of sympathy with elevated
      sentiments and with generous character. The character of Sir Charles
      Grandison, in spite of his ceremonious bowing on the hand, touched the
      nobler feelings of our young hero's mind, inspired him with virtuous
      emulation, and made him ambitious to be a <i>gentleman</i> in the best and
      highest sense of the word: in short, it completely counteracted in his
      mind the effects of his late study. All the generous feelings which were
      so congenial to his own nature, and which he had seen combined in Tom
      Jones, as if necessarily, with the habits of an adventurer, a spendthrift,
      and a rake, he now saw united with high moral and religious principles, in
      the character of a man of virtue, as well as a man of honour; a man of
      cultivated Understanding, and accomplished manners. In Sir Charles
      Grandison's history, he read that of a gentleman, who, fulfilling every
      duty of his station in society, eminently <i>useful</i>, respected and
      beloved, as brother, friend, master of a family, guardian, and head of a
      large estate, was admired by his own sex, and, what struck Ormond far more
      forcibly, was loved, passionately loved, by women&mdash;not by the low and
      profligate, but by the highest and most accomplished of the sex. Indeed,
      to him it appeared no fiction, while he was reading it; his imagination
      was so full of Clementina, and the whole Porretta family, that he saw them
      in his sleeping and waking dreams. The deep pathos so affected him, that
      he could scarcely recall his mind to the low concerns of life. Once, when
      King Corny called him to go out shooting&mdash;he found him with red eyes.
      Harry was ashamed to tell him the cause, lest he should laugh at him. But
      Corny was susceptible of the same kind of enthusiasm himself; and though
      he had, as he said, never been regularly what is called a <i>reading man</i>,
      yet the books he had read left ineffaceable traces in his memory.
      Fictions, if they touched him at all, struck him with all the force of
      reality; and he never spoke of the characters as in a book, but as if they
      had lived and acted. Harry was glad to find that here again, as in most
      things, they sympathized, and suited each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Corny, if ready to give sympathy, was likewise imperious in requiring
      it; and Harry was often obliged to make sudden transitions from his own
      thoughts and employments, to those of his friend. These transitions,
      however difficult and provoking at the time, were useful discipline to his
      mind, giving him that versatility, in which persons of powerful
      imagination, accustomed to live in retirement, and to command their own
      time and occupations, are often most deficient. At this period, when our
      young hero was suddenly seized with a voracious appetite for books, it was
      trying to his patience to be frequently interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come&mdash;Harry Bookworm you are growing!&mdash;no good!&mdash;come
      out!" cried King Corny. "Lay down whatever you have in your hand, and come
      off this minute, till I show you a badger at bay, with half-a-dozen dogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir&mdash;this minute&mdash;be kind enough to wait one minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been hiding and skulking this week from me&mdash;we have got it
      out of its snug hole at last. I bid them keep the dogs off till you came.
      Don't be waiting any longer. Come off, Harry, come! Phoo! phoo! That book
      will keep cold, and what is it? Oh! the last volume of Sir Charles&mdash;not
      worth troubling your eyes with. The badger is worth a hundred of it&mdash;not
      a pin's worth in that volume but worked stools and chairs, and China jugs
      and mugs. Oh! throw it from you. Come away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time, at the very death of Clarissa, King Corny would have Harry
      out to see a Solan goose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! let Clarissa die another time; come now, you that never saw a Solan
      goose&mdash;it looks for all the world as if it wore spectacles; Moriarty
      says so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was carried off to see the goose in spectacles, and was pressed into
      the service of King Corny for many hours afterwards, to assist in
      searching for its eggs. One of the Black Islands was a bare, high,
      pointed, desert rock, in which the sea-fowl built; and here, in the
      highest point of rock, this Solan goose had deposited some of her eggs,
      instead of leaving them in nests on the ground, as she usually does. The
      more dangerous it was to obtain the eggs, which the bird had hidden in
      this pinnacle of the rock, the more eager Corny was to have them; and he,
      and Ormond, and Moriarty, were at this perilous work for hours. King Corny
      directing and bawling, and Moriarty and Ormond with pole, net, and
      polehook, swinging and leaping from one ledge of rock to another,
      clambering, clinging, sliding, pushing, and pulling each other
      alternately, from hold to hold, with frightful precipices beneath them. As
      soon as Ormond had warmed to the business, he was delighted with the
      dangerous pursuit; but suddenly, just as he had laid his hand on the egg,
      and that King Corny shouted in triumph, Harry, leaping back across the
      cleft in the rock, missed his footing and fell, and must have been dashed
      to pieces, but for a sort of projecting landing-place, on which he was
      caught, where he lay for some minutes stunned. The terror of poor Corny
      was such that he could neither move nor look up, till Moriarty called out
      to him, that Master Harry was safe all to a sprained ankle. The fall, and
      the sprain, would not have been deemed worthy of a place in these memoirs
      of our hero but from their consequences&mdash;the consequences not on his
      body but on his mind. He could not for some weeks afterwards stir out, or
      take any bodily exercise; confined to the house, and forced to sit still,
      he was glad to read, during these long hours, to amuse himself. When he
      had read all the novels in the collection, which were very few, he went on
      to other books. Even those, which were not mere works of amusement, he
      found more entertaining than netting, fishing-nets, or playing backgammon
      with Father Jos, who was always cross when he did not win. Kind-hearted
      King Corny, considering always that Harry's sprain was incurred in his
      service, would have sat with him all day long; but this Harry would not
      suffer, for he knew that it was the greatest <i>punishment</i> to Corny to
      stay within doors a whole day. When Corny in the evening returned from his
      various out-of-doors occupations and amusements, Harry was glad to talk to
      him of what he had been reading, and to hear his odd summary reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Harry, my boy, now I've told you how it has been with me all day,
      let's hear how you have been getting on with your bookmen:&mdash;has it
      been a good day with you to-day?&mdash;were you with Shakspeare&mdash;worth
      all the rest&mdash;all the world in him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corny was no respecter of authorities in hooks; a great name went for
      nothing with him&mdash;it did not awe his understanding in the slightest
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were poetry, "did it touch the heart, or inflame the imagination?"
      If it were history, "was it true?" If it were philosophy, "was it sound
      reasoning?" These were the questions he asked. "No cramming any thing down
      his throat," he said. This daring temper of mind, though it sometimes led
      him wrong, was advantageous to his young friend. It wakened Ormond's
      powers, and prevented his taking upon trust the assertions, or the
      reputations, even of great writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring was now returning, and Dora was to return with spring. He
      looked forward to her return as to a new era in his existence: then he
      should live in better company, he should see something better than he had
      seen of late&mdash;be something better. His chief, his best occupations
      during this winter, had been riding, leaping, and breaking in horses: he
      had broken in a beautiful mare for Dora. Dora, when a child, was very fond
      of riding, and constantly rode out with her father. At the time when Harry
      Ormond's head was full of Tom Jones, Dora had always been his idea of
      Sophy Western, though nothing else that he could recollect in her person,
      mind, or manner, bore any resemblance to Sophia: and now that Tom Jones
      had been driven out of his head by Sir Charles Grandison; now that his
      taste for women was a little raised by the pictures which Richardson had
      left in his imagination, Dora, with equal facility, turned into his new
      idea of a heroine&mdash;not <i>his</i> heroine, for she was engaged to
      White Connal&mdash;merely a heroine in the abstract. Ormond had been
      warned that he was to consider Dora as a married woman&mdash;well, so he
      would, of course. She was to be Mrs. Connal&mdash;so much the better:&mdash;he
      should be quite at ease with her, and she should teach him French, and
      drawing, and dancing, and improve his manners. He was conscious that his
      manners had, since his coming to the Black Islands, rusticated sadly, and
      lost the little polish they had acquired at Castle Hermitage, and during
      one <i>famous</i> winter in Dublin. His language and dialect, he was
      afraid, had become somewhat vulgar; but Dora, who had been refined by her
      residence with her aunt, and by her dancing-master, would polish him, and
      set all to rights, in the most agreeable manner possible. In the course of
      these his speculations on his rapid improvements, and his reflections on
      the perfectibility of man's nature under the tuition of woman, some idea
      of its fallibility did cross his imagination or his memory; but then he
      blamed, most unjustly, his imagination for the suggestion. The danger
      would prove, as he would have it, to be imaginary. What danger could there
      be, when he knew, as he began and ended by saying to himself, that he was
      to consider Dora as a married woman&mdash;Mrs. Connal?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora's aunt, an aunt by the mother's side, a maiden aunt, who had never
      before been at the Black Islands, and whom Ormond had never seen, was to
      accompany Dora on her return to Corny Castle: our young hero had settled
      it in his head that this aunt must be something like Aunt Ellenor in Sir
      Charles Grandison; a stiff-backed, prim, precise, old-fashioned looking
      aunt. Never was man's astonishment more visible in his countenance than
      was that of Harry Ormond on the first sight of Dora's aunt. His surprise
      was so great as to preclude the sight of Dora herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing surprising in the lady, but there was, indeed, an
      extraordinary difference between our hero's preconceived notion, and the
      real person whom he now beheld. <i>Mademoiselle</i>&mdash;as Miss O'Faley
      was called, in honour of her French parentage and education, and in
      commemoration of her having at different periods spent above half her life
      in France, looking for an estate that could never be found&mdash;Mademoiselle
      was dressed in all the peculiarities of the French dress of that day; she
      was of that indefinable age, which the French describe by the happy phrase
      of "une femme <i>d'un certain age</i>," and which Miss O'Faley happily
      translated, "a woman of <i>no particular age</i>." Yet though of no
      particular age in the eye of politeness, to the vulgar eye she looked like
      what people, who knew no better, might call an elderly woman; but she was
      as alert and lively as a girl of fifteen: a little wrinkled, but withal in
      fine preservation. She wore abundance of rouge, obviously&mdash;still more
      obviously took superabundance of snuff&mdash;and without any obvious
      motive, continued to play unremittingly a pair of large black French eyes,
      in a manner impracticable to a mere Englishwoman, and which almost tempted
      the spectator to beg she would let them rest. Mademoiselle, or Miss
      O'Faley, was in fact half French and half Irish&mdash;born in France, she
      was the daughter of an officer of the Irish brigade, and of a French lady
      of good family. In her gestures, tones, and language, there was a striking
      mixture or rapid succession of French and Irish. When she spoke French,
      which she spoke well, and with a true Parisian accent, her voice,
      gestures, air, and ideas, were all French; and she looked and moved a
      well-born, well-bred woman: the moment she attempted to speak English,
      which she spoke with an inveterate brogue, her ideas, manner, air, voice,
      and gestures were Irish; she looked and moved a vulgar Irishwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you see so wonderful in Aunt O'Faley?" said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing&mdash;only&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was never finished, and the young lady was satisfied; for she
      perceived that the course of his thoughts was interrupted, and all idea of
      her aunt effaced, the moment he turned his eyes upon herself. Dora, no
      longer a child and his playfellow, but grown and formed, was, and looked
      as if she expected to be treated as, a woman. She was exceedingly pretty,
      not regularly handsome, but with most brilliant eyes&mdash;there was
      besides a childishness in her face, and in her slight figure, which
      disarmed all criticism on her beauty, and which contrasted strikingly, yet
      as our hero thought agreeably, with her womanish airs and manner. Nothing
      but her external appearance could be seen this first evening&mdash;she was
      tired and went to bed early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond longed to see more of her, on whom so much of his happiness was to
      depend.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This was the first time Mdlle. O'Faley had ever been at Corny Castle.
      Hospitality, as well as gratitude, determined the King of the Black
      Islands to pay her honour due.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now Harry Ormond," said he, "I have made one capital good resolution.
      Here is my sister-in-law, Mdlle. O'Faley, coming to reside with me here,
      and has conquered her antipathy to solitude, and the Black Islands, and
      all from natural love and affection for my daughter Dora; for which I have
      a respect for her, notwithstanding all her eternal jabbering about <i>politesse</i>,
      and all her manifold absurdities, and infinite female vanities, of which
      she has a double proportion, being half French. But so was my wife, that I
      loved to distraction&mdash;for a wise man may do a foolish thing. Well, on
      all those accounts, I shall never contradict or gainsay this Mademoiselle&mdash;in
      all things, I shall make it my principle to give her her swing and her
      fling. But now observe me, Harry, I have no eye to her money&mdash;let her
      leave that to Dora or the cats, whichever pleases her&mdash;I am not
      looking to, nor squinting at, her succession. I am a great hunter, but not
      legacy-hunter&mdash;that is a kind of hunting I despise&mdash;and I wish
      every hunter of that kind may be thrown out, or thrown off, and may never
      be in at the death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Corny's tirade against legacy-hunters was highly approved of by Ormond,
      but as to the rest, he knew nothing about Miss O'Faley's fortune. He was
      now to learn that a rich relation of hers, a merchant in Dublin, whom
      living she had despised, because he was "neither <i>noble</i>, nor <i>comme
      il faut</i>," dying had lately left her a considerable sum of money: so
      that after having been many years in straitened circumstances, she was now
      quite at her ease. She had a carriage, and horses, and servants; she could
      indulge her taste for dress, and make a figure in a country place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Islands were, to be sure, of all places, the most unpromising
      for her purpose, and the first sight of Corny Castle was enough to throw
      her into despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as breakfast was over, she begged her brother-in-law would show
      her the whole of the chateau from the top to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the pleasure in life, he said, he would attend her from the
      attics to the cellar, and show her all the additions, improvements, and
      contrivances, he had made, and all he intended to make, if Heaven should
      lend him life to complete every thing, or any thing&mdash;there was
      nothing <i>finished</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor ever will be," said Dora, looking from her father to her aunt with a
      sort of ironical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what has he been doing all this life?" said mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Making a <i>shift</i>," said Dora: "I will show you dozens of them as we
      go over this house. He calls them substitutes&mdash;<i>I</i> call them
      make-shifts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond followed as they went over the house; and though he was sometimes
      amused by the smart remarks which Dora made behind backs as they went on,
      yet he thought she laughed too scornfully at her father's <i>oddities</i>,
      and he was often in pain for his good friend Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty was both proud and ashamed of his palace: proud of the various
      instances it exhibited of his taste, originality, and <i>daring</i>;
      ashamed of the deficiencies and want of comfort and finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ready wit had excuses, reasons, or remedies, for all Mademoiselle's
      objections. Every alteration she proposed, he promised to get executed,
      and he promised impossibilities with the best faith imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the Frenchman answered to the Queen of France," said Corny, "if it is
      possible, it <i>shall</i> be done; and if it is impossible, it <i>must</i>
      be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle, who had expected to find her brother-in-law, as she owned, a
      little more difficult to manage, a little savage, and a little restive,
      was quite delighted with his politeness; but presuming on his
      complaisance, she went too far. In the course of a week, she made so many
      innovations, that Corny, seeing the labour and ingenuity of his life in
      danger of being at once destroyed, made a sudden stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Corny Castle, Mademoiselle," said he, "and you are making it
      Castle Topsy-Turvy, which must not be. Stop this work; for I'll have no
      more architectural innovations done here&mdash;but by my own orders. Paper
      and paint, and furnish and finish, you may, if you will&mdash;I give you a
      carte-blanche; but I won't have another wall touched, or chimney pulled
      down: so far shalt thou go, but no farther, Mdlle. O'Faley." Mademoiselle
      was forced to submit, and to confine her brilliant imagination to
      papering, painting, and glazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the course of these operations, King Corny became so impatient,
      that she was forced to get them finished surreptitiously, while he was out
      of the way in the mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made out who resided at every place within possible reach of morning
      or dinner visit: every house on the opposite banks of the lake was soon
      known to her, and she was current in every house. The boat was constantly
      rowing backwards and forwards over the lake; cars waiting or driving on
      the banks: in short, this summer all was gaiety at the Black Islands. Miss
      O'Faley was said to be a great acquisition in the neighbourhood: she was
      so gay, so sociable, so communicative; and she certainly, above all, knew
      so much of the world; she was continually receiving letters, and news, and
      patterns, from Dublin, and the Black Rock, and Paris. Each of which
      places, and all standing nearly upon the same level, made a great figure
      in her conversation, and in the imagination of the half or quarter gentry,
      with whom she consorted in this remote place. Every thing is great or
      small by comparison, and she was a great person in this little world. It
      had been the report of the country, that her niece was promised to the
      eldest son of Mr. Connal of Glynn; but the aunt seemed so averse to the
      match, and expressed this so openly, that some people began to think it
      would be broken off; others, who knew Cornelius O'Shane's steadiness to
      his <i>word of honour</i>, were convinced that Miss O'Faley would never
      shake King Corny, and that Dora would assuredly be Mrs. Connal. All agreed
      that it was a foolish promise&mdash;that he might do better for his
      daughter. Miss O'Shane, with her father's fortune and her aunt's, would be
      a great prize; besides, she was thought quite a beauty, and <i>remarkable
      elegant</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora was just the thing to be the belle and coquette of the Black Islands;
      the alternate scorn and familiarity with which she treated her admirers,
      and the interest and curiosity she excited, by sometimes taking delightful
      pains to attract, and then capriciously repelling, <i>succeeded</i>, as
      Miss O'Faley observed, admirably. Harry Ormond accompanied her and her
      aunt on all their parties of pleasure: Miss O'Faley would never venture in
      the boat or across the lake without him. He was absolutely essential to
      their parties: he was useful in the boat; he was useful to drive the car&mdash;Miss
      O'Faley would not trust any body else to drive her; he was an ornament to
      the ball&mdash;Miss O'Faley dubbed him her beau: she undertook to polish
      him, and to teach him to speak French&mdash;she was astonished by the
      quickness with which he acquired the language, and caught the true
      Parisian pronunciation. She often reiterated to her niece, and to others,
      who repeated it to Ormond, "that it was the greatest of pities he had but
      three hundred a year upon earth; but that, even with that pittance, she
      would prefer him for a nephew to another with his thousands. Mr. Ormond
      was well-born, and he had some <i>politesse</i>; and a winter at Paris
      would make him quite another person, quite a charming young man. He would
      have great <i>success</i>, she could answer for it, in certain <i>circles</i>
      and <i>salons</i> that she could name, only it might turn his head too
      much." So far she said, and more she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a million of pities that such a woman as herself, and such a girl
      as Dora, and such a young man as Mr. Ormond might be made, should be
      buried all their days in the Black Islands. Mdlle. O'Faley's heart still
      turned to Paris: in Paris she was determined to live&mdash;there was no <i>living</i>,
      what you call <i>living</i>, any where else&mdash;elsewhere people only
      vegetate, as somebody said. Miss O'Faley, nevertheless, was excessively
      fond of her niece; and how to make the love for her niece and the love for
      Paris coincide, was the question. She long had formed a scheme of carrying
      her dear niece to Paris, and marrying her there to some M. le Baron or M.
      le Marquis; but Dora's father would not hear of her living any where but
      in Ireland, or marrying any one but an Irishman. Miss O'Faley had lived
      long enough in Ireland to know that the usual method, in all disputes, is
      to split the difference: therefore she decided that her niece should marry
      some Irishman who would take her to Paris, and reside with her there, at
      least a great part of his time&mdash;the latter part of the bargain to be
      kept a secret from the father till the marriage should be accomplished.
      Harry Ormond appeared to be the very man for this purpose: he seemed to
      hang loosely upon the world&mdash;no family connexions seemed to have any
      rights over him; he had no profession&mdash;but a very small fortune. Miss
      O'Faley's fortune might be very convenient, and Dora's person very
      agreeable to him; and it was scarcely to be doubted that he would easily
      be persuaded to quit the Black Islands, and the British Islands, for
      Dora's sake. The petit menage was already quite arranged in Mdlle.
      O'Faley's head&mdash;even the wedding-dresses had floated in her fancy.
      "As to the promise given to White Connal," as she said to herself, "it
      would be a mercy to save her niece from such a man; for she had seen him
      lately, when he had called upon her in Dublin, and he was a vulgar person:
      his hair looked as if it had not been cut these hundred years, and he wore&mdash;any
      thing but what he should wear; therefore it would be a favour to her
      brother-in-law, for whom she had in reality a serious regard,&mdash;it
      would be doing him the greatest imaginable benefit, to save him from the
      shame of either keeping or breaking his ridiculous and savage promise."
      Her plan was therefore to prevent the possibility of his keeping it, by
      marrying her niece privately to Ormond before White Connal should return
      in October. When the thing was done, and could not be undone, Cornelius
      O'Shane, she was persuaded, would be very glad of it, for Harry Ormond was
      his particular favourite: he had called him his son&mdash;son-in-law was
      almost the same thing. Thus arguing with happy female casuistry,
      Mademoiselle went on with the prosecution of her plan. To the French
      spirit of intrigue and gallantry she joined Irish acuteness, and Irish
      varieties of odd resource, with the art of laying suspicion asleep by the
      appearance of an imprudent, blundering good nature; add to all this a
      degree of <i>confidence</i>, that could not have been acquired by any
      means but one. Thus accomplished, "rarely did she manage matters." By the
      very boldness and openness of her railing against the intended bridegroom,
      she convinced her brother-in-law that she meant nothing more than <i>talk</i>.
      Besides, through all her changing varieties of objections, there was one
      point on which she never varied&mdash;she never objected to going to
      Dublin, in September, to buy the wedding-clothes for Dora. This seemed to
      Cornelius O'Shane perfect proof, that she had no serious intention to
      break off or defer the match. As to the rest, he was glad to see his own
      Harry such a favourite: he deserved to be a favourite with every body,
      Cornelius thought. The young people were continually together. "So much
      the better," he would say: "all was above-board, and there could be no
      harm going forward, and no danger in life." All was above-board on Harry
      Ormond's part; he knew nothing of Miss O'Faley's designs, nor did he as
      yet feel that there was for him much <i>danger</i>. He was not thinking as
      a lover of Dora in particular, but he felt a new and extraordinary desire
      to please in general. On every fair occasion, he liked to show how well he
      could ride; how well he could dance; how gallant and agreeable he could
      be: his whole attention was now turned to the cultivation of his personal
      accomplishments. He succeeded: he danced, he rode to admiration&mdash;his
      glories of horsemanship, and sportsmanship, the birds that he shot, and
      the fish that he caught, and the leaps that he took, are to this hour
      recorded in the tradition of the inhabitants of the Black Islands. At that
      time, his feats of personal activity and address made him the theme of
      every tongue, the delight of every eye, the admiration of every woman, and
      the envy of every man: not only with the damsels of Peggy Sheridan's class
      was he <i>the</i> favourite, but with all the young ladies, the belles of
      the half gentry, who filled the ball-rooms; and who made the most
      distinguished figure in the riding, boating, walking, tea-drinking
      parties. To all, or any of these belles, he devoted his attention rather
      than to Dora, for he was upon honour; and very honourable he was, and very
      prudent, moreover, he thought himself. He was, at present, quite content
      with general admiration: there was, or there seemed, at this time, more
      danger for his head than his heart&mdash;more danger that his head should
      be turned with the foolish attentions paid him by many silly girls, than
      that he should be a dupe to a passion for any one of them: there was
      imminent danger of his becoming a mere dancing, driving, country coxcomb.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day when Harry Ormond was out shooting with Moriarty Carroll, Moriarty
      abruptly began with, "Why then, 'tis what I am thinking, Master Harry,
      that King Corny don't know as much of that White Connal as I do." "What do
      <i>you</i> know of Mr. Connal?" said Harry, loading his piece. "I didn't
      know you had ever seen him." "Oh! but I did, and no great sight to see.
      Unlike the father, old Connal, of Glynn, who is the gentleman to the last,
      every inch, even with the coat dropping off his back; and the son, with
      the best coat in Christendom, has not the look of a gentleman at-all&mdash;at-all&mdash;nor
      hasn't it in him, inside no more than outside." "You may be mistaken
      there, as you have never been withinside of him, Moriarty," said Ormond.
      "Oh! faith, and if I have not been withinside of him, I have heard enough
      from them that seen him turned inside out, hot and cold. Sure I went down
      there last summer, to his country, to see a shister of my own that's
      married in it; and lives just by Connal's Town, as the man calls that
      sheep farm of his." "Well, let the gentleman call his own place what he
      will&mdash;" "Oh! he may call it what he plases for me&mdash;I know what
      the country calls him; and lest your honour should not ax me, I'll tell
      you: they call him White Connal the negre!&mdash;Think of him that would
      stand browbating the butcher an hour, to bate down the farthing a pound in
      the price of the worst bits of the mate, which he'd bespake always for the
      servants; or stand, he would&mdash;I've seen him with my own eyes&mdash;higgling
      with the poor child with the apron round the neck, that was sent to sell
      him the eggs&mdash;" "Hush! Moriarty," said Ormond, who did not wish to
      hear any farther particulars of Mr. Connal's domestic economy: and he
      silenced Moriarty, by pointing to a bird. But the bird flew away, and
      Moriarty returned to his point. "I wouldn't be telling the like of any
      jantleman, but to show the nature of him. The minute after he had screwed
      the halfpenny out of the child, he'd throw down, may be, fifty guineas in
      gould, for the horse he'd fancy for his own riding: not that he rides
      better than the sack going to the mill, nor so well; but that he might
      have it to show, and say he was better mounted than any man at the fair:
      and the same he'd throw away more guineas than I could tell, at the head
      of a short-horned bull, or a long-horned bull, or some kind of a bull from
      England, may be, just becaase he'd think nobody else had one of the breed
      in all Ireland but himself." "A very good thing, at least, for the
      country, to improve the breed of cattle." "The country!&mdash;'Tis little
      the man thinks of the country that never thought of any thing but himself,
      since his mother sucked him." "Suckled him, you mean," said Harry. "No
      matter&mdash;I'm no spaker&mdash;but I know that man's character
      nevertheless: he is rich; but a very bad character the poor gives him up
      and down." "Perhaps, because he is rich." "Not at all; the poor loves the
      rich that helps with the kind heart. Don't we all love King Corny to the
      blacking of his shoes?&mdash;Oh! there's the difference!&mdash;who could
      like the man that's always talking of the <i>craturs</i>, and yet, to save
      the life of the poorest cratur that's forced to live under him, wouldn't
      forbear to drive, and pound, and process, for the little <i>con</i> acre,
      the potatoe ridge, the cow's grass, or the trifle for the woman's peck of
      flax, was she dying, and sell the woman's last blanket?&mdash;White Connal
      is a hard man, and takes all to the uttermost farthing the law allows."
      "Well, even so, I suppose the law does not allow him more than his due,"
      said Ormond. "Oh! begging your pardon, Master Harry," said Moriarty,
      "that's becaase you are not a lawyer." "And are you?" said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only as we all are through the country. And now I'll only just tell you,
      Master Harry, how this White Connal sarved my shister's husband, who was
      an under-tenant to him:&mdash;see, the case was this&mdash;" "Oh! don't
      tell me a long case, for pity's sake. I am no lawyer&mdash;I shall not
      understand a word of it." "But then, sir, through the whole consarning
      White Connal, what I'm thinking of, Master Harry," said Moriarty, "is, I'm
      grieving that a daughter of our dear King Corny, and such a pretty likely
      girl as Miss Dora&mdash;" "Say no more, Moriarty, for there's a
      partridge." "Oh! is it so with you?" thought Moriarty&mdash;"that's just
      what I wanted to know&mdash;and I'll keep your secret: I don't forget
      Peggy Sheridan&mdash;and his goodness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty said not a word more about White Connal, or Miss Dora; and he and
      Harry shot a great many birds this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is astonishing how quickly, and how justly, the lower class of people
      in Ireland discover and appreciate the characters of their superiors,
      especially of the class just above them in rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond hoped that Moriarty had been prejudiced in his account of White
      Connal, and that private feelings had induced him to exaggerate. Harry was
      persuaded of this, because Cornelius O'Shane had spoken to him of Connal,
      and had never represented him to be a <i>hard</i> man. In fact, O'Shane
      did not know him. White Connal had a property in a distant county, where
      he resided, and only came from time to time to see his father. O'Shane had
      then wondered to see the son grown so unlike the father; and he attributed
      the difference to White Connal's having turned grazier. The having
      derogated from the dignity of an idle gentleman, and having turned grazier
      was his chief fault in King Corny's eyes: so that the only point in
      Connal's character and conduct, for which he deserved esteem, was that for
      which his intended father-in-law despised him. Connal had early been
      taught by his father's example, who was an idle, decayed, good gentleman,
      of the old Irish stock, that genealogies and old maps of estates in other
      people's possessions, do not gain quite so much respect in this world as
      solid wealth. The son was determined, therefore, to get money; but in his
      horror of his father's indolence and poverty, he ran into a contrary
      extreme&mdash;he became not only industrious, but rapacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      In going lately to Dublin to settle with a sales master, he had called on
      Dora at her aunt's in Dublin, and he had been "greatly struck," as he
      said, "with Miss O'Shane; she was as fine a girl as any in Ireland&mdash;turn
      out who they could against her; all her <i>points</i> good. But, better
      than beauty, she would be no contemptible fortune: with her aunt's
      assistance, she would cut up well; she was certain of all her father's
      Black Islands&mdash;fine improvable land, if well managed."
    </p>
    <p>
      These considerations had their full effect. Connal, knowing that the young
      lady was his destined bride, had begun by taking the matter coolly, and
      resolving to wait for the properest time to wed; yet the sight of Dora's
      charms had so wrought upon him, that he was now impatient to conclude the
      marriage immediately. Directly after seeing Dora in Dublin, he had gone
      home and "put things in order and in train to bear his absence," while he
      should pay a visit to the Black Islands. Business, which must always be
      considered before pleasure, had detained him at home longer than he had
      foreseen: but now certain rumours he heard of gay doings in the Black
      Islands, and a letter from his father, advising him not to delay longer
      paying his respects at Corny Castle, determined him to set out. He wrote
      to Mr. O'Shane to announce his intention, and begged to have the answer
      directed to his father's at Glynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning as Miss O'Faley, Mr. O'Shane, and Ormond, were at breakfast,
      Dora, who was usually late, not having yet appeared, Miss O'Faley saw a
      little boy running across the fields towards the house. "That boy runs as
      if he was bringing news," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he has a right to do," said Corny: "if I don't mistake that's the
      post; that is, it is not the post, but a little <i>special</i> of my own&mdash;a
      messenger I sent off to <i>catch post</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To do what?" said Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to catch post," said Corny. "I bid him gallop off for the life and
      <i>put across (lake</i> understood) to the next post town, which is
      Ballynaslugger, and to put in the letters that were too late here at that
      office there; and to bring back whatever he found, with no delay&mdash;but
      gallop off for the bare life."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an operation which the boy performed, whenever requisite, at the
      imminent hazard of his neck every time, to say nothing of his chance of
      drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Catch-post, my little rascal," said King Corny, "what have you for
      us the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got nothing at all, only a wetting for myself, plase your honour, and
      one bit of a note for your honour, which I have here for you as dry as the
      bone in my breast."
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced the bit of a note, which, King Corny's hands being at that
      time too full of the eggs and the kettle to receive graciously, was laid
      down on the corner of the table, from which it fell, and Miss O'Faley
      picking it up, and holding it by one corner, exclaimed, "Is this what you
      call dry as a bone, in this country? And mighty clean, too&mdash;faugh!
      When will this entire nation leave off chewing tobacco, I wonder! This is
      what you style clean, too, in this country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," said the boy, looking close at the letter, "I thought it was
      clane enough when I got it&mdash;and give it&mdash;but 'tis not so clane
      now, sure enough; this corner&mdash;whatever come over it&mdash;would it
      be the snuff, my lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mark of Miss O'Faley's thumb was so visible, and the snuff so
      palpable, and the effort to brush it from the wet paper so disastrous,
      that Miss O'Faley let the matter rest where it was. King Corny put silver
      into the boy's hand, bidding him not be too much of a rogue; the boy,
      smiling furtively, twitched the hair on his forehead, bobbed his head in
      sign of thanks, and drawing, not shutting, the door after him,
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As sure as I'm Cornelius O'Shane, this is White Connal <i>in propria
      persona</i>," said he, opening the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon Dieu! Bon Dieu! Ah, Dieu!" cried Mdlle. O'Faley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! Whisht!" cried the father&mdash;"here's Dora coming." Dora came in.
      "Any letter for me?" "Ay, darling, one for <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, give it me! I'm always in a desperate hurry for my letters: where is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;you need not hold out your pretty hand; the letter is <i>for you</i>,
      but not to you," said King Corny; "and now you know&mdash;ay, now you
      guess&mdash;my quick little blusher, who 'tis from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess? not I, indeed&mdash;not worth my guessing," cried Dora, throwing
      herself sideways into a chair. "My tea, if you please, aunt." Then, taking
      the cup, without adverting to Harry, who handed it to her, she began
      stirring the tea, as if it and all things shared her scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma chre! mon chat!" said Mdlle. O'Faley, "you are quite right to spare
      yourself the trouble of guessing; for I give it you in two, I give it you
      in four, I give it you in eight, and you would never guess right. Figure
      to yourself only, that a man, who has the audacity to call himself a lover
      of Miss O'Shane's, could fold, could seal, could direct a letter in such a
      manner as this, which you here behold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora, who during this speech had sat fishing for sugar in her tea-cup,
      raised her long eyelashes, and shot a scornful glance at the letter; but
      intercepting a crossing look of Ormond's, the expression of her
      countenance suddenly changed, and with perfect composure she observed, "A
      man may fold a letter badly, and be nevertheless a very good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That nobody can possibly contradict," said her father; "and on all
      occasions 'tis a comfort to be able to say what no one can contradict."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No well-bred person will never contradict nothing," said Miss O'Faley.
      "But, without contradicting you, my child." resumed Miss O'Faley, "I
      maintain the impossibility of his being a <i>gentleman</i> who folds a
      letter so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if folding a letter is all a man wants of being a gentleman," said
      Dora, "it might be learnt, I should think; it might be taught&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were the teacher, Dora, it might, surely," said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Heaven, I trust, will arrange that better," said mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever Heaven arranges must be best," said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven and your father, if you please, Dora," said her father: "put that
      and that together, like a dutiful daughter, as you must be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must!" said Dora, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That offensive <i>must</i> slipped out by mistake, darling; I meant only
      being <i>you</i>, you must be all that's dutiful and good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Dora, "that's another view of the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a very imperfect view of the subject, yet," said her father;
      "for you have both been so taken up with the manner, that you have never
      thought of inquiring into the matter of this letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is the matter?" said Miss O'Faley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Form</i>!" continued the father, addressing himself to his daughter; "<i>form</i>,
      I acknowledge, is one thing, and a great thing in a daughter's eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora blushed. "But in a father's eyes substance is apt to be more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora raised her cup and saucer together to her lips at this instant, so
      that the substance of the saucer completely hid her face from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Miss O'Faley, "you have not told us yet what the man says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says he will be here whenever we please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's never," said Miss O'Faley: "never, I'd give for answer, if my
      pleasure is to be consulted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Luckily, there's another person's pleasure to be consulted here," said
      the father, keeping his eyes fixed upon his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another cup of tea, aunt, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the sooner the better, I say," continued her father; "for when a
      disagreeable thing is to be done&mdash;that is, when a thing that's not
      quite agreeable to a young lady, such as marriage&mdash;" Dora took the
      cup of tea from her aunt's hand, Harry not interfering&mdash;"I say,"
      persisted her father, "the sooner it's done and over, the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora saw that Ormond's eyes were fixed upon her: she suddenly tasted, and
      suddenly started back from her scalding tea; Harry involuntarily uttered
      some exclamation of pity; she turned, and seeing his eyes still fixed upon
      her, said, "Very rude, sir, to stare at any one so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only thought you had scalded yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you only thought wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate, there's no great occasion to be angry with me, Dora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is angry, pray, Mr. Ormond? What put it in your head that I was
      doing you the honour to be angry with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cream! the cream!" cried Miss O'Faley.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden motion, we must not say an angry motion of Dora's elbow, had at
      this moment overset the cream ewer; but Harry set it up again, before its
      contents poured on her new riding-habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said she, "thank you; but," added she, changing the places of
      the cream ewer and cups and saucers before her, "I'd rather manage my own
      affairs my own way, if you'd let me, Mr. Ormond&mdash;if you'd leave me&mdash;I
      can take care of myself my own way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon for saving your habit from destruction, for that is the
      only cause of offence that I am conscious of having given. But I leave you
      to your own way, as I am ordered," said he, rising from the breakfast
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sparring! sparring again, you two!" said Dora's father: "but, Dora, I
      wonder whether you and White Connal were sparring that way when you met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time enough for that, sir, after marriage," said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero, who had stood leaning on the back of his chair, fearing that he
      had been too abrupt in what he had said, cast a lingering look at Dora, as
      her father spoke about White Connal, and as she replied; but there was
      something so unfeminine, so unamiable, so decided and bold, he thought, in
      the tone of her voice, as she pronounced the word <i>marriage</i>, that he
      then, without reluctance, and with a feeling of disgust, quitted the room,
      and left her "to manage her own affairs, and to take her own way."

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our young hero, hero-like, took a solitary walk to indulge his feelings;
      and as he rambled, he railed to his heart's content against Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here all my plans of happiness and improvement are again overturned: Dora
      cannot improve me, can give me no motive for making myself any thing
      better than what I am. Polish my manners! no, when she has such rude,
      odious manners herself; much changed for the worse&mdash;a hundred times
      more agreeable when she was a child. Lost to me she is every way&mdash;no
      longer my playfellow&mdash;no chance of her being my friend. Her good
      father hoped she would be a sister to me&mdash;very sorry I should be to
      have such a sister: then I am to consider her as a married woman&mdash;pretty
      wife she will make! I am convinced she cares no more for that man she is
      going to marry than I do&mdash;marrying merely to be married, to manage
      her own affairs, and have her own way&mdash;so childish!&mdash;or marrying
      merely to get an establishment&mdash;so base! How women, and such young
      creatures, <i>can</i> bring themselves to make these venal matches&mdash;I
      protest Peggy Sheridan's worth a hundred of such. Moriarty may think
      himself a happy fellow&mdash;Suzy&mdash;Jenny, any body&mdash;only with
      dress and manner a little different&mdash;is full as good in reality. I
      question whether they'd give themselves, without liking, to any White
      Connal in their own rank, at the first offer, for a few sheep, or a cow,
      or to have their own way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the summing up of the topics of invective, which, during a two
      hours' walk, had come round and round continually in Ormond's indignant
      fancy. He went plucking off the hawthorn blossoms in his path, till at one
      desperate tug, that he gave to a branch which crossed his way, he opened
      to a bank that sloped down to the lake. At a little distance below him he
      saw old Sheelah sitting under a tree rocking herself backwards and
      forwards; while Dora stood motionless opposite to her, with her hand
      covering her eyes, and her head drooping. They neither of them saw Ormond,
      and he walked on pursuing his own path; it led close behind the hedge to
      the place where they were, so close, that the sounds "Willastrew!
      Willastrew!" from Old Sheelah, in her funereal tone, reached his ear, and
      then the words, "Oh, my heart's darling! so young to be a sacrifice&mdash;But
      what next did he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's curiosity was strongly excited; but he was too honourable to
      listen or to equivocate with conscience: so to warn them that some one was
      within hearing, he began to whistle clear and strong. Both the old woman
      and the young lady started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder!" cried Sheelah, "it's Harry Ormond. Oh! did he overhear any thing&mdash;or
      all, think ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," answered Ormond, leaping over the hedge directly, and standing
      firm before them: "I <i>overheard</i> nothing&mdash;I <i>heard</i> only
      your last words, Sheelah&mdash;you spoke so loud I could not help it. They
      are as safe with me as with yourself&mdash;but don't speak so loud another
      time, if you are talking secrets; and whatever you do, never suspect me of
      listening&mdash;I am incapable of <i>that</i>, or any other baseness."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned his back, and was preparing to vault over the hedge
      again, when he heard Dora, in a soft low voice, say, "I never suspected
      you, Harry, of that, or any other baseness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Dora," said he, turning with some emotion, "thank you, Dora,
      for this first, this only kind word you've said to me since you came
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at her earnestly, as he approached nearer, he saw the traces of
      tears, and an air of dejection in her countenance, which turned all his
      anger to pity and tenderness in an instant. With a soothing tone he said,
      "Forgive my unseasonable reproach&mdash;I was wrong&mdash;I see you are
      not as much to blame as I thought you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To blame!" cried Dora. "And pray how&mdash;and why&mdash;and for what did
      you think me to blame, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The impossibility of explanation, the impropriety of what he had said
      flashed suddenly on his mind; and in a few moments a rapid succession of
      ideas followed. "Was Dora to blame for obeying her father, for being ready
      to marry the man to whom her father had destined&mdash;promised her hand;
      and was he, Harry Ormond, the adopted child, the trusted friend of the
      family, to suggest to the daughter the idea of rebelling against her
      father's will, or disputing the propriety of his choice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's imagination took a rapid flight on Dora's side of the question,
      and he finished with the <i>conviction</i> that she was "a sacrifice, a
      martyr, and a miracle of perfection!" "Blame you, Dora!" cried he, "blame
      you! No&mdash;I admire, I esteem, I respect you. Did I say that I blamed
      you? I did not know what I said, or what I meant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you sure you know any better what you say or what you mean, now?"
      said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      The altered look and tone of tartness in which this question was asked
      produced as sudden a change in Harry's <i>conviction</i>. He hesitatingly
      answered, "I am&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," said Sheelah, confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not ask your opinion, Sheelah: I can judge for myself," said Dora.
      "Your words tell me one thing, sir, and your looks another," said she,
      turning to Ormond; "which am I to believe, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! believe the young man any way, sure," said Sheelah; "silence speaks
      best for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best against him, in my opinion," said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dora, will you hear me?" Ormond began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I will not," interrupted Dora. "What's the use of hearing or
      listening to a man who does not, by the confession of his own eyes, and
      his own tongue, know two minutes together <i>what</i> he means, or mean
      two minutes together the same thing? A woman might as well listen to a
      fool or a madman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too harsh, too severe, Dora," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too true, too sincere, perhaps you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I am allowed, Dora, to speak to you as a brother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who allowed you, sir?" interrupted Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father, Dora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father cannot, shall not! Nobody but nature can make any man my
      brother&mdash;nobody but myself shall allow any man to call himself my
      brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I presumed so far, Miss O'Shane&mdash;I was only going to
      offer one word of advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want no advice&mdash;I will take none from you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have none, madam, henceforward, from Harry Ormond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis well, sir. Come away, Sheelah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! wait, dear&mdash;Och! I am too old," said Sheelah, groaning as she
      rose slowly. "I'm too slow entirely for these quick passions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Passions!" cried Dora, growing scarlet and pale in an instant: "what do
      you mean by passions, Sheelah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean <i>changes</i>," said Sheelah, "changes, dear. I am ready now&mdash;where's
      my stick? Thank you, Master Harry. Only I say I can't change my quarters
      and march so quick as you, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, lean on me," said Dora impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hurry, poor Sheelah&mdash;no necessity to hurry away from me," said
      Ormond, who had stood for a few moments like one transfixed. "'Tis for me
      to go&mdash;and I will go as fast and as far as you please, Dora, away
      from you and for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For ever!" said Dora: "what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away from the Black Islands? he can't mean that," said Sheelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?&mdash;Did not I leave Castle Hermitage at a moment's warning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Warning!</i> Nonsense!" cried Dora: "lean on him, Sheelah&mdash;he has
      frightened you; lean on him, can't you?&mdash;sure he's better than your
      stick. Warning!&mdash;where did you find that pretty word? Is Harry Ormond
      then turned footman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry Ormond!&mdash;and a minute ago she would not let me&mdash;Miss
      O'Shane, I shall not forget myself again&mdash;amuse yourself with being
      as capricious as you please, but not at my expense; little as you think of
      me, I am not to be made your butt or your dupe: therefore, I must
      seriously beg, at once, that I may know whether you wish me to stay or to
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To stay, to be sure, when my father invites you. Would you expose me to
      his displeasure? you know he can't bear to be contradicted; and you know
      that he asked you to stay and live here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But without exposing you to any displeasure, I can," replied Ormond,
      "contrive&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contrive nothing at all&mdash;do leave me to contrive for myself. I don't
      mean to say <i>leave</i> me&mdash;you take up one's words so quickly, and
      are so passionate, Mr. Ormond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you would have me understand you, Dora, explain how you wish me to
      live with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord bless me! what a fuss the man makes about living with one&mdash;one
      would think it was the most difficult thing in the world. Can't you live
      on like any body else? There's my aunt in the hedge-row walk, all alone&mdash;I
      must go and take care of her: I leave you to take care of Sheelah&mdash;you
      know you were always very good-natured when we were children."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora went off quick as lightning, and what to make of her, Ormond did not
      well know. Was it mere childishness, or affectation, or coquetry? No; the
      real tears, and real expression of look and word forbade each of these
      suppositions. One other cause for her conduct might have been suggested by
      a vain man. Harry Ormond was not a vain man; but a little fluttering
      delight was just beginning to play round his head, when Sheelah, leaning
      heavily on his arm as they ascended the bank, reminding him of her
      existence&mdash;"My poor old Sheelah!" said he, "are you not tired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now, thanks to your arm, Master Harry, dear, that was always good to
      me&mdash;not now&mdash;I am not a whit tired; now I see all right again
      between my childer&mdash;and happy I was, these five minutes past,
      watching you smiling to yourself; and I don't doubt but all the world will
      smile on ye yet. If it was my world, it should. But I can only wish you my
      best wish, which I did long ago&mdash;<i>may you live to wonder at your
      own good luck!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond looked as if he was going to ask some question that interested him
      much, but it ended by wondering what o'clock it was. Sheelah wondered at
      him for thinking what the hour was, when she was talking of Miss Dora.
      After a silence, which brought them to the chicken-yard door, where
      Sheelah was "to quit his arm," she leaned heavily again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The marriage&mdash;that they are all talking of in the kitchen, and every
      where through the country&mdash;Miss Dora's marriage with White Connal, is
      reprieved for the season. She axed time till she'd be seventeen&mdash;very
      rasonable. So it's to be in October&mdash;if we all live till those days&mdash;in
      the same mind. Lord, he knows&mdash;I know nothing at all about it; but I
      thank you kindly, Master Harry, and wish you well, any way. Did you ever
      happen to see the bridegroom that is to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry longed to hear what she longed to say; but he did not deem it
      prudent, he did not think it honourable, to let her enter on this topic.
      The prudential consideration might have been conquered by curiosity; but
      the honourable repugnance to obtaining second-hand information, and
      encouraging improper confidence, prevailed. He deposited Sheelah safe on
      her stone bench at the chicken-yard door, and, much against her will, he
      left her before she had told or hinted to him all she did know&mdash;and
      all she did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flattering delight that played about our young hero's head had
      increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished. Of this he was
      sensible. It should never come near his heart&mdash;of that he was
      determined; he would exactly follow the letter and spirit of his
      benefactor's commands&mdash;he would always consider Dora as a married
      woman; but the prospect of there being some temptation, and some struggle,
      was infinitely agreeable to our young hero&mdash;it would give him
      something to do, something to think of, something to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was much in favour of his resolution, that Dora really was not at all
      the kind of woman he had pictured to himself, either as amiable or
      charming: she was not in the least like his last patterns of heroines, or
      any of his approved imaginations of the <i>beau ideal</i>. But she was an
      exceedingly pretty girl; she was the only very pretty and tolerably
      accomplished girl immediately near him. A dangerous propinquity!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      White Connal and his father&mdash;we name the son first, because his
      superior wealth inverting the order of nature, gave him, in his own
      opinion, the precedency on all occasions&mdash;White Connal and his father
      arrived at Corny Castle. King Corny rejoiced to see his old friend, the
      elder Connal; but through all the efforts that his majesty made to be more
      than civil to the son, the degenerate grazier, his future son-in-law, it
      was plain that he was only keeping his promise, and receiving such a guest
      as he ought to be received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle decided that old Connal, the father, was quite a gentleman,
      for he handed her about, and in his way had some politeness towards the
      sex; but as for the son, her abhorrence must have burst forth in plain
      English, if it had not exhaled itself safely in French, in every
      exclamation of contempt which the language could afford. She called him <i>bte!</i>
      and <i>grand bte!</i> by turns, <i>butor! ne!</i> and <i>grand butor!&mdash;nigaud!</i>
      and <i>grand nigaud!</i>&mdash;pronounced him to be "Un homme qui ne dit
      rien&mdash;d'ailleurs un homme qui n'a pas l'air comme il faut&mdash;un
      homme, enfin, qui n'est pas prsentable&mdash;mme en fait de mari."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora looked unutterable things; but this was not unusual with her. Her
      scornful airs, and short answers, were not more decidedly rude to White
      Connal than to others; indeed she was rather more civil to him than to
      Ormond. There was nothing in her manner of keeping Connal at a distance,
      beyond what he, who had not much practice or skill in the language of
      female coquetry, might construe into maiden coyness to the acknowledged
      husband lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if she had some secret hope, or fear, or reason, for not
      coming to open war: in short, as usual, she was odd, if not
      unintelligible. White Connal did not disturb himself at all to follow her
      doublings: his pleasure was not in the chase&mdash;he was sure the game
      was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be bold, but not too bold, White Connal!&mdash;be negligent, but not too
      negligent, of the destined bride. 'Tis bad, as you say, to be spoiling a
      <i>wife</i> before marriage; but what if she should never <i>be</i> your
      wife? thought some.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a contingency that never had occurred to White Connal. Had he not
      horses, and saddles, and bridles, and bits, finer than had ever been seen
      before in the Black Islands? And had he not thousands of sheep, and
      hundreds of oxen? And had he not the finest pistols, and the most famous
      fowling-pieces? And had he not thousands in paper, and thousands in gold;
      and if he lived, would he not have tens of thousands more? And had he not
      brought with him a plan of Connal's-town, the name by which he dignified a
      snug slated lodge he had upon one of his farms&mdash;an elevation of the
      house to be built, and of the offices that had been built?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had so. But it happened one day, when Connal was going to ride out with
      Dora, that just as he mounted, her veil fluttering before his horse's
      eyes, startled the animal; and the awkward rider being unable to manage
      him, King Corny begged Harry Ormond to change horses with him, that Mr.
      Connal might go quietly beside Dora, "who was a bit of a coward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Imprudent father! Harry obeyed&mdash;and the difference between the riders
      and the gentlemen was but too apparent. For what avails it that you have
      the finest horse, if another ride him better? What avails it that you have
      the finest saddle, if another become it better? What use to you your
      Wogden pistols, if another hit the mark you miss? What avails the finest
      fowling-piece to the worst sportsman? The thousands upon thousands to him
      who says but little, and says that little ill? What avail that the offices
      at Connal's town be finished, dog-kennel and all? or what boots it that
      the plan and elevation of Connal's-town be unrolled, and submitted to the
      fair one's inspection and remarks, if the fair disdain to inspect, and if
      she remark only that a cottage and love are more to her taste? White
      Connal put none of these questions to himself&mdash;he went on his own
      way. Faint heart never won fair lady. Then no doubt he was in a way to
      win, for his heart never quailed, his colour never changed when he saw his
      fair one's furtive smiles, or heard her aunt's open praises of the youth,
      by whom riding, dancing, shooting, speaking, or silent, he was always
      eclipsed. Connal of Connal's-town despised Harry Ormond of no-town&mdash;viewed
      him with scornful, but not with jealous eyes: idle jealousies were far
      from Connal's thoughts&mdash;he was intent upon the noble recreation of
      cock-fighting. Cock-fighting had been the taste of his boyish days, before
      he became a money-making man; and at every interval of business, at each
      intermission of the passion of avarice, when he had leisure to think of
      amusement, this his first idea of pleasure recurred. Since he came to
      Corny Castle, he had at sundry times expressed to his father his "hope in
      Heaven, that before they would leave the Black Islands, they should get
      some good <i>fun</i>, cock-fighting; for it was a poor case for a man that
      is not used to it, to be tied to a woman's apron-strings, twirling his
      thumbs all the mornings, for form's sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strolling kind of gentleman in the Islands, a Mr. O'Tara, who
      was a famous cock-fighter. O'Tara came one day to dine at Corny Castle.
      The kindred souls found each other out, and an animated discourse across
      the table commenced concerning cocks. After dinner, as the bottle went
      round, the rival cock-fighters, warmed to enthusiasm in praise of their
      birds. Each relating wonders, they finished by proposing a match, laying
      bets and despatching messengers and hampers for their favourites. The
      cocks arrived, and were put in separate houses, under the care of separate
      feeders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty Carroll, who was curious, and something of a sportsman, had a
      mind to have a peep at the cocks. Opening the door of one of the buildings
      hastily, he disturbed the cock, who taking fright, flew about the barn
      with such violence, as to tear off several of his feathers, and very much
      to deface his appearance. Unfortunately, at this instant, White Connal and
      Mr. O'Tara came by, and finding what had happened, abused Moriarty with
      all the vulgar eloquence which anger could supply. Ormond, who had been
      with Moriarty, but who had no share in the disaster, endeavoured to
      mitigate the fury of White Connal and apologized to Mr. O'Tara: O'Tara was
      satisfied!&mdash;shook hands with Ormond, and went off. But White Connal's
      anger lasted longer: for many reasons he disliked Ormond; and thinking
      from Harry's gentleness, that he might venture to insult him, returned to
      the charge, and becoming high and brutal in his tone, said that "Mr.
      Ormond had committed an ungentlemanlike action, which it was easier to
      apologize for than to defend." Harry took fire, and instantly was much
      more ready than his opponent wished to give any other satisfaction that
      Mr. Connal desired. Well, "Name his hour&mdash;his place." "To-morrow
      morning, six o'clock, in the east meadow, out of reach and sight of all,"
      Ormond said; or he was ready at that instant, if Mr. Connal pleased: he
      hated, he said, to bear malice&mdash;he could not sleep upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty now stepping up privately, besought Mr. Connal's "honour, for
      Heaven and earth's sake, to recollect, if he did not know it, what a
      desperate good shot Mr. Harry notoriously was always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, you rascal! are you here still?" cried White Connal: "Hold your
      peace! How dare you speak between gentlemen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty begged pardon and departed. The hint he had given, however,
      operated immediately upon White Connal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This scattered-brained young Ormond," said he to himself, "desires
      nothing better than to fight. Very natural&mdash;he has nothing to lose in
      the world but his bare life: neither money, nor landed property as I have
      to quit, in leaving the world&mdash;unequal odds. Not worth my while to
      stand his shot, for the feather of a cock," concluded Connal, as he pulled
      to pieces one of the feathers, which had been the original cause of all
      the mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus cooled, and suddenly become reasonable, he lowered his tone,
      declaring that he did not mean to say any thing in short that could give
      offence, nothing but what it was natural for any man in the heat of
      passion to say, and it was enough to put a man in a passion at first sight
      to see his favourite bird disfigured. If he had said any thing too strong,
      he hoped Mr. Ormond would excuse it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond knew what the heat of passion was, and was willing to make all
      proper allowances. White Connal made more than proper apologies; and
      Ormond rejoiced that the business was ended. But White Connal, conscious
      that he had first bullied, then quailed, and that if the story were
      repeated, it would tell to his disadvantage, made it his anxious request
      that he would say nothing to Cornelius O'Shane of what had passed between
      them, lest it should offend Cornelius, who he knew was so fond of Mr.
      Ormond. Harry eased the gentleman's mind, by promising that he would never
      say a word about the matter. Mr. Connal was not content till this promise
      was solemnly repeated. Even this, though it seemed quite to satisfy him at
      the time, did not afterwards relieve Connal from the uneasy consciousness
      he felt in Ormond's company. He could bear it only the remainder of this
      day. The next morning he left the Black Islands, having received letters
      of business, he said, which required his immediate presence at
      Connal's-town. Many at Corny Castle seemed willing to dispense with his
      further stay, but King Corny, true to his word and his character, took
      leave of him as his son-in-law, and only, as far as hospitality required,
      was ready to "speed the parting guest." At parting, White Connal drew his
      future father-in-law aside, and gave him a hint, that he had better look
      sharp after that youth he was fostering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry Ormond, do you mean?" said O'Shane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," said Connal: "but, Mr. O'Shane, don't go to mistake me, I am not
      jealous of the man&mdash;not capable&mdash;of such a fellow as that&mdash;a
      wild scatterbrains, who is not worth a sixpence scarce&mdash;I have too
      good an opinion of Miss Dora. But if I was in your place, her father, just
      for the look of the thing in the whole country, I should not like it: not
      that I mind what people say a potato skin; but still, if I was her father,
      I'd as soon have the devil an inmate and intimate in my house, nuzzling in
      my daughter's ear behind backs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius O'Shane stoutly stood by his young friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never saw Harry Ormond <i>muzzling</i>&mdash;behind backs, especially&mdash;did
      not believe any such thing: all Harry said and did was always above-board,
      and before faces, any way. "In short," said Cornelius, "I will answer for
      Harry Ormond's honour with my own honour. After that, 'twould be useless
      to add with my life, if required&mdash;that of course; and this ought to
      satisfy any son-in-law, who was a gentleman&mdash;none such could glance
      or mean to reflect on Dora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal, perceiving he had overshot himself, made protestations of his
      innocence of the remotest intention of glancing at, or reflecting upon, or
      imagining any thing but what was perfectly angelic and proper in Miss Dora&mdash;Miss
      O'Shane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that was all as it should be," Mr. O'Shane said, "so far: but
      another point he would not concede to mortal man, was he fifty times his
      son-in-law promised, that was, his own right to have who he pleased and <i>willed</i>
      to have, at his own castle, his inmate and his intimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt&mdash;to be sure," Connal said: "he did not mean&mdash;he only
      meant&mdash;he could not mean&mdash;in short, he meant nothing at all,
      only just to put Mr. O'Shane on his guard&mdash;that was all he meant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Phoo!" said Cornelius O'Shane; but checking the expression of his
      contempt for the man, he made an abrupt transition to Connal's horse,
      which had just come to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a handsome horse! certainly you are well mounted, Mr. Connal."
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Shane's elision of contempt was beyond Mr. Connal's understanding or
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well mounted! certainly I am <i>that</i>, and ever will be, while I can
      so well afford it," said Connal, mounting his horse; and identifying
      himself with the animal, he sat proudly, then bowing to the ladies, who
      were standing at an open window, "Good day to ye, ladies, till October,
      when I hope&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But his horse, who did not seem quite satisfied of his identity with the
      man, would not permit him to say more, and off he went&mdash;half his
      hopes dispersed in empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know I wish," said Cornelius O'Shane to himself, as he stood on the
      steps, looking after the man and horse, "I wish that that unlucky bowl of
      punch had remained for ever unmixed, at the bottom of which I found this
      son-in-law for my poor daughter, my innocent Dora, then unborn; but she
      must make the best of him for me and herself, since the fates and my word,
      irrevocable as the Styx, have bound me to him, the purse-proud grazier and
      mean man&mdash;not a remnant of a gentleman! as the father was. Oh, my
      poor Dora!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As King Corny heaved a heartfelt sigh, very difficult to force from his
      anti-sentimental bosom, Harry Ormond, with a plate of meat in his hand,
      whistling to his dog to follow him, ran down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave feeding that dog, and come here to me, Harry," said O'Shane, "and
      answer me truly such questions as I shall ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Truly</i>&mdash;if I answer at all," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer you must, when I ask you: every man, every gentleman, must answer
      in all honour for what he does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, answer <i>for</i> what he does," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>For!</i>&mdash;Phoo! Come, none of your tricks upon prepositions to
      gain time&mdash;I never knew you do the like&mdash;you'll give me a worse
      opinion. I'm no schoolmaster, nor you a grammarian, I hope, to be
      equivocating on monosyllables."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Equivocate! I never equivocated, sir," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't begin now, then," said Cornelius: "I've enough to put me out of
      humour already&mdash;so answer straight, like yourself. What's this you've
      done to get the ill-will of White Connal, that's just gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised and embarrassed, Ormond answered, "I trust I have not his
      ill-will, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have, sir," said O'Shane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible?" cried Harry, "when we shook hands&mdash;You must have
      misunderstood, or have been misinformed. How do you know, my dear sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it from the man's own lips, see! I can give you a straight answer
      at once. Now answer me, was there any quarrel between you? and what cause
      of offence did you give?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, sir&mdash;those are questions which I cannot answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your blush, young man, answers me enough, and too much. Mark me, I
      thought I could answer for your honour with my own, and I did so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir, and you shall never have reason&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't interrupt me, young man. What reason can I have to judge of the
      future, but from the past? I am not an idiot to be bothered with fair
      words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir, can you suspect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect nothing, Harry Ormond: I am, I thank my God, above suspicion.
      Listen to me. You know&mdash;whether I ever told it you before or not, I
      can't remember&mdash;but whether or not, you <i>know</i> as well as if you
      were withinside of me&mdash;that in my heart's core there's not a man
      alive I should have preferred for my son-in-law to the man I once thought
      Harry Ormond, without a penny&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once thought!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interrupt me again, and I'll lave you, sir. In confidence between
      ourselves, thinking as once I did, that I might depend on your friendship
      and discretion, equally with your honour, I confessed, I repented a rash
      promise, and let you see my regret deep enough that my son-in-law will
      never be what Dora deserves&mdash;I said, or let you see as much, no
      matter which; I am no equivocator, nor do I now unsay or retract a word.
      You have my secret; but remember when first I had the folly to tell it
      you, same time I warned you&mdash;I warned you, Harry, like the moth from
      the candle&mdash;I warned you in vain. In another tone I warn you now,
      young man, for the last time&mdash;I tell you my promise to me is sacred&mdash;she
      is as good as married to White Connal&mdash;fairly tied up neck and heels&mdash;and
      so am I, to all intents and purposes; and if I thought it were possible
      you could consider her, or make her by any means consider herself, in any
      other light, I will tell you what I would do&mdash;I would shoot myself;
      for one of us must fall, and I wouldn't choose it should be you, Harry.
      That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! hear me, sir," cried Harry, seizing his arm as he turned away, "kill
      me if you will, but hear me&mdash;I give you my word you are from
      beginning to end mistaken. I cannot tell you the whole&mdash;but this much
      believe, Dora was not the cause of quarrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there was a quarrel. Oh, for shame! for shame!&mdash;you are not
      used to falsehood enough yet&mdash;you can't carry it through&mdash;why
      did you attempt it with <i>me</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, though I can't tell you the truth, the foolish truth, I tell you no
      falsehood. Dora's name, a thought of Dora, never came in question between
      Mr. Connal and me, upon my honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your honour!" repeated Cornelius, with a severe look&mdash;severe more in
      its sorrow than its anger. "O Harry Ormond! what signifies whether the
      name was mentioned? You know she was the thing&mdash;the cause of offence.
      Stop! I charge you&mdash;equivocate no more. If a lie's beneath a
      gentleman, an equivocation is doubly beneath a man."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harry Ormond thought it hard to bear unmerited reproach and suspicion;
      found it painful to endure the altered eye of his once kind and always
      generous, and to him always dear, friend and benefactor. But Ormond had
      given a solemn promise to White Connal never to mention any thing that had
      passed between them to O'Shane; and he could not therefore explain these
      circumstances of the quarrel. Conscious that he was doing right, he kept
      his promise to the person he hated and despised, at the hazard, at the
      certainty, of displeasing the man he most loved in the world; and to whom
      he was the most obliged. While his heart yearned with tenderness towards
      his adopted father, he endured the reproach of ingratitude; and while he
      knew he had acted perfectly honourably, he suffered under the suspicion of
      equivocation and breach of confidence: he bore it all; and in reward he
      had the conviction of his own firmness, and an experience, upon trial, of
      his adherence to his word of honour. The trial may seem but trivial, the
      promise but weak: still it was a great trial to him, and he thought the
      promise as sacred as if it had been about an affair of state.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened some days after the conversation had passed between him and
      O'Shane, that Cornelius met O'Tara, the gentleman who had laid the bets
      about the cock-fight with Connal; and chancing to ask him what had
      prevented the intended battle, O'Tara told all he knew of the adventure.
      Being a good-natured and good-humoured man, he stated the matter as
      playfully as possible&mdash;acknowledged that they had all been foolish
      and angry; but that Harry Ormond and Moriarty had at last pacified them by
      proper apologies. Of what had passed afterwards, of the bullying, and the
      challenge, and the submission, O'Tara knew nothing; but King Corny having
      once been put on the right scent, soon made it all out. He sent for
      Moriarty, and cross-questioning him, heard the whole; for Moriarty had not
      been sworn to secrecy, and had very good ears. When he had been turned out
      of the stable, he had retreated only to the harness-room, and had heard
      all that had passed. King Corny was delighted with Harry's spirit&mdash;and
      now he was Prince Harry again, and the generous, warm-hearted Cornelius
      went, in impatience, to seek him out, and to beg his pardon for his
      suspicions. He embraced him, called him son, and dear son&mdash;said he
      had now found out, no thanks to him, Connal's cause of complaint, and it
      had nothing to do with Dora.&mdash;"But why could not you say so, man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said so repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, so I suppose it is to be made out clearly to be all my fault, that
      was in a passion, and could not hear, understand, or believe. Well, be it
      so; if I was unjust, I'll make it up to you, for I'll never believe my own
      ears, or eyes, against you, Harry, while I live, depend upon it:&mdash;if
      I heard you asking her to marry you, I would believe my ears brought me
      the words wrong; if I saw you even leading her into the church instead of
      the chapel, and the priest himself warning me of it, I'd say and think,
      Father Jos, 'tis a mistake&mdash;a vision&mdash;or a defect of vision. In
      short, I love and trust you as my own soul, Harry Ormond, for I did you
      injustice."
    </p>
    <p>
      This full return of kindness and confidence, besides the present delight
      it gave him, left a permanent and beneficial impression upon our young
      hero's mind. The admiration he felt for O'Shane's generous conduct, and
      the self-approbation he enjoyed in consequence of his own honourable
      firmness, had a great effect in strengthening and forming his character:
      it also rendered him immediately more careful in his whole behaviour
      towards Miss O'Shane. He was prudent till both aunt and niece felt
      indignant astonishment. There was some young lady with whom Harry had
      danced and walked, and of whom he had, without any design, spoken as a
      pleasing <i>gentle</i> girl. Dora recollected this praise, and joining it
      with his present distant behaviour toward herself, she was piqued and
      jealous; and then she became, what probably she would never otherwise have
      been, quite decided in her partiality for Harry Ormond. The proofs of this
      were soon so manifest, that many thought, and Miss O'Faley in particular,
      that Harry was grown stupid, blind, and deaf. He was net stupid, blind, or
      deaf&mdash;he had felt the full power of Dora's personal charms, and his
      vanity had been flattered by the preference which Dora showed for him.
      Where vanity is the ruling passion, young men are easily flattered into
      being in love with any pretty, perhaps with any ugly girl, who is, or who
      affects to be, in love with them. But Harry Ormond had more tenderness of
      heart than vanity: against the suggestions of his vanity he had struggled
      successfully; but now his heart had a hard trial. Dora's spirits were
      failing, her cheek growing pale, her tone of voice was quite softened;
      sighs would sometimes break forth&mdash;persuasive sighs!&mdash;Dora was
      no longer the scornful lady in rude health, but the interesting invalid&mdash;the
      victim going to be sacrificed. Dora's aunt talked of the necessity of <i>advice</i>
      for her niece's health. Great stress was laid on air and exercise, and
      exercise on horseback. Dora rode every day on the horse Harry Ormond broke
      in for her, the only horse she could now ride; and Harry understood <i>its
      ways</i>, and managed it so much better than any body else; and Dora was
      grown a coward, so that it was quite necessary he should ride or walk
      beside her. Harry Ormond's tenderness of heart increased his idea of the
      danger. Her personal charms became infinitely more attractive to him; her
      defects of temper and character were forgotten and lost in his sense of
      pity and gratitude; and the struggle of his feelings was now violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning our young hero rose early, for he could no longer sleep, and
      he walked out, or, more properly, he rambled, or he strolled, or <i>streamed</i>
      out, and he took his way&mdash;no, his steps were irresistibly led&mdash;to
      his accustomed haunt by the water side, under the hawthorn bank, and there
      he walked and picked daisies, and threw stones into the lake, and he
      loitered on, still thinking of Dora and death, and of the circles in the
      water, and again of the victim and of the sacrifice, when suddenly he was
      roused from his reverie by a shrill whistle, that seemed to come from the
      wood above, and an instant afterwards he heard some one shouting, "Harry
      Ormond!&mdash;Harry Ormond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here!" answered Harry; and as the shouts were repeated he recognized the
      voice of O'Tara, who now came, whip in hand, followed by his dogs, running
      down the bank to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Harry Ormond, I've brought great news with me for all at Corny
      Castle; but the ladies are not out of their nests, and King Corny's Lord
      knows how far off. Not a soul or body to be had but yourself here, by good
      luck, and you shall have the first of the news, and the telling of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Ormond; "and what is the news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First and foremost," said O'Tara, "you know birds of a feather flock
      together. White Connal, though, except for the cock-fighting, I never
      relished him, was mighty fond of me, and invited me down to Connal's-town,
      where I've been with him this week&mdash;you know that much, I conclude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry owned he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Tara wondered how he could help knowing it. "But so it was; we had a
      great cock-fight, and White Connal, who knew none of my <i>secrets</i> in
      the feeding line, was bet out and out, and angry enough he was; and then I
      offered to change birds with him, and beat him with his own Ginger by my
      superiority o' feeding, which he scoffed at, but lookup the bet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond sighed with impatience in vain&mdash;he was forced to submit, and
      to go through the whole detail of the cock-fight. "The end of it was, that
      White Connal was <i>worsted</i> by his own bird, and then mad angry was
      he. So, then," continued O'Tara, "to get the triumph again on his side,
      one way or another, was the thing. I had the advantage of him in dogs,
      too, for he kept no hounds&mdash;you know he is close, and hounds lead to
      a gentlemanlike expense; but very fine horses he had, I'll acknowledge,
      and, Harry Ormond, you can't but remember that one which he could not
      manage the day he was out riding here with Miss Dora, and you changed with
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember it well," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and he has got reason to remember it now, sure enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he had a fall?" said Ormond, stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walk on, can't ye&mdash;keep up, and I'll tell you all regular."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is King Corny!" exclaimed Ormond, who just then saw him come in
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, then," cried O'Tara, leaping over a ditch that was between them,
      and running up to King Corny. "Great news for you, King Corny, I've
      brought&mdash;your son-in-law elect, White Connal, is off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Off&mdash;how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the world clean! Poor fellow, broke his neck with that horse he
      could never manage&mdash;on Sunday last. I left him for dead Sunday night&mdash;found
      him dead Monday morning&mdash;came off straight with the news to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" repeated Corny and Harry, looking at one another. "Heaven forbid!"
      said Corny, "that I should&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid!" repeated Harry; "but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But good morning to you both, then," said O'Tara: "shake hands either
      way, and I'll condole or congratulate to-morrow as the case may be, with
      more particulars if required."
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Tara ran off, saying he would be back again soon; but he had great
      business to do. "I told the father last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am no hypocrite," said Corny. "Rest to the dead and all their faults!
      White Connal is out of my poor Dora's way, and I am free from my accursed
      promise!" Then clasping his hands, "Praised be Heaven for <i>that</i>!&mdash;Heaven
      is too good to me!&mdash;Oh, my child! how unworthy White Connal of her!&mdash;Thank
      Heaven on my knees, with my whole heart, thank Heaven that I am not forced
      to the sacrifice!&mdash;My child, my darling Dora, she is free!&mdash;Harry
      Ormond, my dear boy, I'm free," cried O'Shane, embracing Harry with all
      the warmth of paternal affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond returned that embrace with equal warmth, and with a strong sense of
      gratitude: but was his joy equal to O'Shane's? What were his feelings at
      this moment? They were in such confusion, such contradiction, he could
      scarcely tell. Before he heard of White Connal's death, at the time when
      he was throwing pebbles into the lake, he desired nothing so much as to be
      able to save Dora from being sacrificed to that odious marriage; he
      thought, that if he were not bound in honour to his benefactor, he should
      instantly make that offer of his hand and heart to Dora, which would at
      once restore her to health, and happiness, and fulfil the wishes of her
      kind, generous father. But now, when all obstacles seemed to vanish&mdash;when
      his rival was no more&mdash;when his benefactor declared his joy at being
      freed from his promise&mdash;when he was embraced as O'Shane's <i>son</i>,
      he did not feel joy: he was surprised to find it; but he could not. Now
      that he could marry Dora, now that her father expected that he should, he
      was not clear that he wished it himself. Quick as obstacles vanished,
      objections recurred: faults which he had formerly seen so strongly, which
      of late compassion had veiled from his view, reappeared; the softness of
      manner, the improvement of temper, caused by love, might be transient as
      passion. Then her coquetry&mdash;her frivolity. She was not that superior
      kind of woman which his imagination had painted, or which his judgment
      could approve of in a wife. How was he to explain this confusion of
      feeling to Corny? Leaning on his arm, he walked on towards the house. He
      saw Corny, smiling at his own meditations, was settling the match, and
      anticipating the joy to all he loved. Harry sighed, and was painfully
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoot across like an arrow to the house," cried Corny, turning suddenly
      to him, and giving him a kind push&mdash;"shoot off, Harry, and bring Dora
      to meet me like lightning, and the poor aunt, too&mdash;'twould be cruel
      else! But what stops you, son of my heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay!" cried Corny, a sudden thought striking him, which accounted for
      Harry Ormond's hesitation; "Stop, Harry! You are right, and I am a fool.
      There is Black Connal, the twin-brother&mdash;oh, mercy!&mdash;against us
      still. May be Old Connal will keep me to it still&mdash;as he couldn't, no
      more than I could, foresee that when I promised Dora that was not then
      born, it would be twins&mdash;and as I said son, and surely I meant the
      son that would be born then&mdash;and twins is all as one as one, they
      say. Promise fettering still! Bad off as ever, may be," said Cornelius.
      His whole countenance and voice changed; he sat down on a fallen tree, and
      rested his hands on his knees. "What shall we do now, Harry, with Black
      Connal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may be a very different man from White Connal&mdash;in every respect,"
      said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Shane looked up for a moment, and then interpreting his own way,
      exclaimed, "That's right, Harry&mdash;that thought is like yourself, and
      the very thought I had myself. We must make no declarations till we have
      cleared the point of honour. Not the most beautiful angel that ever took
      woman's beautiful form&mdash;and that's the greatest temptation man can
      meet&mdash;could tempt my Harry Ormond from the straight path of honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Ormond stood at this moment abashed by praise which he did not quite
      deserve. "Indeed, sir," said he, "you give me too much credit." "I cannot
      give you too much credit; you are an honourable young man, and I
      understand you through and through."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was more than Harry himself did. Corny went on talking to himself
      aloud, "Black Connal is abroad these great many years, ever since he was a
      boy&mdash;never saw him since a child that high&mdash;an officer he is in
      the Irish brigade now&mdash;black eyes and hair; that was why they called
      him Black Connal&mdash;Captain Connal now; and I heard the father say he
      was come to England, and there was some report of his going to be married,
      if I don't mistake," cried Corny, turning again to Harry, pleasure
      rekindling in his eye. "If that should be! there's hope for us still; but
      I see you are right not to yield to the hope till we are clear. My first
      step, in honour, no doubt, must be across the lake this minute to the
      father&mdash;Connal of Glynn; but the boat is on the other side. The horn
      is, with my fishing-tackle, Harry, down yonder&mdash;run, for you can run&mdash;horn
      the boat, or if the horn be not there, sign to the boat with your
      handkerchief&mdash;bring it up here, and I will put across before ten
      minutes shall be over&mdash;my horse I will have down to the water's edge
      by the time you have got the boat up&mdash;when an honourable tough job is
      to be done, the sooner the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse was brought to the water's edge, the boat came across, Corny and
      his horse were in; and Corny, with his own hands on the oar, pushed away
      from land: then calling to Harry, he bid him wait on the shore <i>by</i>
      such an hour, and he should have the first news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rest on your oars, you, while I speak to Prince Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you may know all, Harry, sooner than I can tell you, if all be safe,
      or as we wish it, see, I'll hoist my neckcloth, <i>white</i>, to the top
      of this oar; if not, the <i>black</i> flag, or none at all, shall tell
      you. Say nothing till then&mdash;God bless you, boy!" Harry was glad that
      he had these orders, for he knew that as soon as Mademoiselle should be
      up, and hear of O'Tara's early visit, with the message he said he had left
      at the house that he brought <i>great news</i>, Mademoiselle would soon
      sally forth to learn what that news might be. In this conjecture Ormond
      was not mistaken. He soon heard her voice "Mon-Dieu!-ing" at the top of
      the bank: he ducked&mdash;he dived&mdash;he darted through nettles and
      brambles, and escaped. Seen or unseen he escaped, nor stopped his flight
      even when out of reach of the danger. As to trusting himself to meet
      Dora's eyes, "'twas what he dared not."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hid, and wandered up and down, till near dinner-time. At last,
      O'Shane's boat was seen returning&mdash;but no white flag! The boat rowed
      nearer and nearer, and reached the spot where Harry stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, my poor boy, I knew I'd find you so," said O'Shane, as he got ashore.
      "There's my hand, you have my heart&mdash;I wish I had another hand to
      give you&mdash;but it's all over with us, I fear. Oh! my poor Dora!&mdash;and
      here she is coming down the bank, and the aunt!&mdash;Oh, Dora! you have
      reason to hate me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To hate you, sir? Impossible!" said Ormond, squeezing his hand strongly,
      as he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!&mdash;true&mdash;for <i>her</i> to hate, who is all love and
      loveliness!&mdash;impossible too for <i>you</i>, Harry Ormond, who is all
      goodness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bon Dieu!" cried Mademoiselle, who was now within exclamation distance.
      "What a <i>course</i> we have had after you, gentlemen! Ladies looking for
      gentlemen!&mdash;C'est inou!&mdash;What is it all? for I am dying with
      curiosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering Mademoiselle, the father, and Harry's eyes, at the same
      moment, were fixed on one who was some steps behind, and who looked as if
      dying with a softer passion. Harry made a step forward to offer his arm,
      but stopped short; the father offered his, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can nobody speak to me?&mdash;Bien poli!" said Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you please, Miss O'Faley, ma'am," cried a hatless footman, who had run
      after the ladies the wrong way from the house: "if you please, ma'am, will
      <i>she</i> send up dinner now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oui, qu'on serve!&mdash;Yes, she will. Let her dish&mdash;by that time
      she is dished, we shall be in&mdash;and have satisfied our curiosity, I
      hope," added she, turning to her brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us dine first," said Cornelius, "and when the cloth is removed, and
      the waiting-ears out of hearing, time enough to have our talk to
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bien singulier, ces Anglois!" muttered Mademoiselle to herself, as they
      proceeded to the house. "Here is a young man, and the most polite of the
      silent company, who may well be in some haste for his dinner; for to my
      knowledge, he is without his breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had no appetite for dinner, but swallowed as much as Mademoiselle
      O'Faley desired. A remarkably silent meal it would have been, but for her
      happy volubility, equal to all occasions. At last came the long expected
      words, "Take away." When all was taken away, and all were gone, but those
      who, as O'Shane said, would too soon wish unheard what they were dying to
      hear, he drew his daughter's chair close to him, placed her so as "to save
      her blushes," and began his story, by relating all that O'Tara had told.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a sudden death&mdash;shocking!" Mademoiselle repeated several
      times; but both she and Dora recovered from the shock, or from the word
      "shocking!" and felt the delight of Dora's being no longer a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a general thanksgiving having been offered for her escape from the
      <i>butor</i>, Mademoiselle, in transports, was going on to say that now
      her niece was free to make a suitable match, and she was just turning to
      wonder that Harry Ormond was not that moment at her niece's feet; and
      Dora's eyes, raised slowly towards him and suddenly retracted, abashed and
      perplexed Harry indescribably; when Corny continued thus: "Dora is not
      free, nor am I free in honour yet, nor can I give any body freedom of
      tongue or heart until I know farther."
    </p>
    <p>
      Various exclamations of surprise and sorrow interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I never, never, to be free!" cried Dora: "Oh! am not I now at
      liberty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me, my child," said her father; "I feel it as you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is it next&mdash;Qu'est-ce que c'est&mdash;this new obstacle?&mdash;What
      can it be?" said Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father then stated sorrowfully, that Old Connal of Glynn would by no
      means relinquish the promise, but considered it equally binding for the
      twin born with White Connal, considering both twins as coming under the
      promise to his <i>son</i> that was to be born. He said he would write
      immediately to his son, who was now in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now tell me what kind of a person is this new pretender, this Mr.
      Black Connal," cried Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of him we know nothing as yet," said O'Shane; "but I hope, in Heaven,
      that the man that is coming is as different from the man that's gone as
      black from white."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry heard Dora breathe quick and quicker, but she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we shall get his answer to the father's letter in eight days, I
      count," said Mademoiselle; "and I have great hopes we shall never be
      troubled with him: we shall know if he will come or not, in eight days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About that time," said O'Shane: "but, sister O'Faley, do not nurse my
      child or yourself up with deceitful hopes. There's not a man alive&mdash;not
      a Connal, surely, hearing what happiness he is heir to, but would come
      flying over post-haste. So you may expect his answer, in eight days&mdash;Dora,
      my darling, and God grant he may be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter what he is, sir&mdash;I'll die before I will see him," cried
      Dora, rising, and bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my child, you won't die!&mdash;you can't&mdash;from me, your father!"
      Her father threw his arms round her, and would have drawn her to him, but
      she turned her face from him: Harry was on the other side&mdash;her eyes
      met his, and her face became covered with blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the window, Harry!" said O'Shane, who saw the conflict; "open the
      window!&mdash;we all want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry opened the window, and hung out of it gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gone&mdash;the aunt has taken her off&mdash;it's over for this
      fit," said O'Shane. "Oh, my child, I must go through with it! My boy, I
      honour as I love you&mdash;I have a great deal to say about your own
      affairs, Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My affairs&mdash;oh! what affairs have I? Never think of me, dear sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will&mdash;but can't now&mdash;I am spent for this day&mdash;leave out
      the bottle of claret for Father Jos, and I'll get to bed&mdash;I'll see
      nobody, tell Father Jos&mdash;I'm gone to my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning O'Tara came to breakfast. Every person had a different
      question to ask him, except Dora, who was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corny asked what kind of man Black Connal was. Mademoiselle inquired
      whether he was most French or English; Ormond, whether he was going to be
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all these questions O'Tara pleaded ignorance: except with respect to
      the sports of the field, he had very little curiosity or intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ray of hope again darted across the mind of Corny. From his knowledge of
      the world, he thought it very probable that a young officer in the French
      brigade would be well contented to be heir to his brother's fortune,
      without encumbering himself with an Irish wife, taken from an obscure part
      of the country. Corny, therefore, eagerly inquired from O'Tara what became
      of White Connal's property. O'Tara answered, that the common cry of the
      country was, that all White Connal's profitable farms were leasehold
      property, and upon his own life. Poor Corny's hopes were thus frustrated:
      he had nothing left to do for some days but to pity Harry Ormond, to bear
      with the curiosity and impatience of Mademoiselle, and with the froward
      sullenness of Dora, till some intelligence should arrive respecting the
      new claimant to her destined hand.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards, Sheelah, bursting into Dora's room, exclaimed,
      "Miss Dora! Miss Dora! for the love of God, they are coming! They're
      coming down the avenue, <i>powdering</i> along! Black Connal himself
      flaming away, with one in a gold hat, this big, galloping after, and all
      gold over, he is entirely!&mdash;Oh! what will become of us, Master Harry,
      now! Oh! it took the sight out of my eyes!&mdash;And yours as red as
      ferrets, dear!&mdash;Oh! the <i>cratur</i>. But come to the window and
      look out&mdash;nobody will mind&mdash;stretch out the body, and I'll hold
      ye fast, never fear!&mdash;at the turn of the big wood do you see them
      behind the trees, the fir dales, glittering and flaming? Do you see them
      at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too plainly," said Dora, sighing; "but I did not expect he would come in
      such a grand style. I wonder&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! so do I, greatly&mdash;mostly at the carriage. Never saw the like
      with the Connals, so grand&mdash;but the queer thing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my dear Dore, un cabriolet!" cried Mademoiselle, entering in ecstacy.
      "Here is Monsieur de Connal for you in a French cabriolet, and a French
      servant riding on to advertise you and all. Oh! what are you twisting your
      neck, child? I will have no toss at him now&mdash;he is all the gentleman,
      you shall see: so let me set you all to rights while your father is
      receive. I would not have him see you such a horrible figure&mdash;not
      presentable! you look&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not care how I look&mdash;the worse the better," said Dora: "I wish
      to look a horrible figure to him&mdash;to Black Connal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! put your Black Connals out of your head&mdash;that is always in your
      mouth: I tell you he is call M. de Connal. Now did I not hear him this
      minute announced by his own valet?&mdash;Monsieur de Connal presents his
      compliments&mdash;he beg permission to present himself&mdash;and there was
      I, luckily, to answer for your father in French."
    </p>
    <p>
      "French! sure Black Connal's Irish born!" said Sheelah: "that much I know,
      any way."
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant knocked at the door with King Corny's request that the ladies
      would come down stairs, to see, as the footman added to his master's
      message, to see old Mr. Connal and the French gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! French, I told you," said Mademoiselle, "and quite the gentleman,
      depend upon it, my dear&mdash;come your ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter what he is," said Dora, "I shall not go down to see him; so you
      had better go by yourself, aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one step! Oh! that would be the height of impolitesse and
      disobedience&mdash;you could not do that, my dear Dore; consider, he is
      not a man that nobody knows, like your old butor of a White Connal. Not
      signify how bad you treat him&mdash;like the dog; but here is a man of a
      certain quality, who knows the best people in Paris, who can talk, and
      tell every where. Oh! in conscience, my dear Dore, I shall not suffer
      these airs with a man who is somebody, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he were the king of France," cried Dora, "if he were Alexander the
      Great himself, I would not be forced to see the man, or marry him against
      my will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry! Who talk of marry? Not come to that yet; ten to one he has no
      thought of you, more than politeness require."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! as to that," said Dora, "aunt, you certainly are mistaken there. What
      do you think he comes over to Ireland, what do you think he comes here
      for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark! then," said Sheelah, "don't I hear them out of the window? Faith!
      there they are, walking and talking and laughing, as if there was nothing
      at all in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just Heavens! What a handsome uniform!" said Miss O'Faley; "and a very
      proper-looking man," said Sheelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, who'd have thought Black Connal, if it's him, would ever have
      turned out so fine a presence of a man to look at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very cavalier, indeed, to go out to walk, without waiting to see us,"
      said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I will engage it was that dear father of yours hoisted him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoisted him out! Well, aunt, you do sometimes speak the oddest English.
      But I do think it strange that he should be so very much at his ease. Look
      at him&mdash;hear him&mdash;I wonder what he is saying&mdash;and Harry
      Ormond!&mdash;Give me my bonnet, Sheelah&mdash;behind you, quick. Aunt,
      let us go out of the garden door, and meet them out walking, by accident&mdash;that
      is the best way&mdash;I long to see how <i>somebody</i> will look."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good&mdash;now you look all life and spirit&mdash;perfectly
      charming! Look that manner, and I'll engage he will fall in love with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had better not, I can tell him, unless he has a particular pleasure in
      being refused," said Dora, with a toss of her head and neck, and at the
      same time a glance at her looking-glass, as she passed quickly out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora and her aunt walked out, and accidentally met the gentlemen in their
      walk. As M. de Connal approached, he gave them full leisure to form their
      opinions as to his personal appearance. He had the air of a foreign
      officer&mdash;easy, fashionable, and upon uncommonly good terms with
      himself&mdash;conscious, but with no vulgar consciousness, of possessing a
      fine figure and a good face: his was the air of a French coxcomb, who in
      unconstrained delight, was rather proud to display, than anxious to
      conceal, his perfect self-satisfaction. Interrupting his conversation only
      when he came within a few paces of the ladies, he advanced with an air of
      happy confidence and Parisian gallantry, begging that Mr. O'Shane would do
      him the honour and pleasure to present him. After a bow, that said
      nothing, to Dora, he addressed his conversation entirely to her aunt,
      walking beside Mademoiselle, and neither approaching nor attempting to
      speak to Dora; he did not advert to her in the least, and seemed scarcely
      to know she was present. This quite disconcerted the young lady's whole
      plan of proceedings&mdash;no opportunity was afforded her of showing
      disdain. She withdrew her arm from her aunt's, though Mademoiselle held it
      as fast as she could&mdash;but Dora withdrew it resolutely, and falling
      back a step or two, took Harry Ormond's arm, and walked with him, talking
      with as much unconcern, and as loudly as she could, to mark her
      indifference. But whether she talked or was silent, walked on with Harry
      Ormond, or stayed behind, whispered or laughed aloud, it seemed to make no
      impression, no alteration whatever in Monsieur de Connal: he went on
      conversing with Mademoiselle, and with her father, alternately in French
      and English. In English he spoke with a native Irish accent, which seemed
      to have been preserved from childhood; but though the brogue was strong,
      yet there were no vulgar expressions: he spoke good English, but generally
      with somewhat of French idiom. Whether this was from habit or affectation
      it was not easy to decide. It seemed as if the person who was speaking,
      thought in French, and translated it into English as he went on. The
      peculiarity of manner and accent&mdash;for there was French mixed with the
      Irish&mdash;fixed attention; and besides Dora was really curious to hear
      what he was saying, for he was very entertaining. Mademoiselle was in
      raptures while he talked of Paris and Versailles, and various people of
      consequence and fashion at the court. The Dauphiness!&mdash;she was then
      but just married&mdash;de Connal had seen all the ftes and the fireworks&mdash;but
      the beautiful Dauphiness!&mdash;In answering a question of Mademoiselle's
      about the colour of her hair, he for the first time showed that he had
      taken notice of Dora. "Nearly the colour, I think, of that young lady's
      hair, as well as one can judge; but powder prevents the possibility of
      judging accurately."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora was vexed to see that she was considered merely <i>as a young lady</i>:
      she exerted herself to take a part in the conversation, but Mr. Connal
      never joined in conversation with her&mdash;with the most scrupulous
      deference he stopped short in the middle of his sentence, if she began to
      speak. He stood aside, shrinking into himself with the utmost care, if she
      was to pass; he held the boughs of the shrubs out of her way, but
      continued his conversation with Mademoiselle all the time. When they came
      in from their walk, the same sort of thing went on. "It really is very
      extraordinary," thought she: "he seems as if he was spell-bound&mdash;obliged
      by his notions of politeness to let me pass incognita."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was so fully engaged, chattering away, that she did not
      perceive Dora's mortification. The less notice Connal took of her, the
      more Dora wished to attract his attention: not that she desired to please
      him&mdash;no, she only longed to have the pleasure of refusing him. For
      this purpose the offer must be made&mdash;and it was not at all clear that
      any offer would be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ladies went to dress before dinner, Mademoiselle, while she was
      presiding at Dora's toilette, expressed how much she was delighted with M.
      de Connal, and asked what her niece thought of him? Dora replied that
      indeed she did not trouble herself to think of him at all&mdash;that she
      thought him a monstrous coxcomb&mdash;and that she wondered what could
      bring so prodigiously fine a gentleman to the Black Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask your own sense what brought him here! or ask your own looking-glass
      what shall keep him here!" said Miss O'Faley. "I can tell you he thinks
      you very handsome already; and when he sees you dress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really! he does me honour; he did not seem as if he had even seen me,
      more than any of the trees in the wood, or the chairs in the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chairs!&mdash;Oh, now you fish for <i>complimens!</i> But I shall not
      tell you how like he thinks you, if you were mise  la Franoise, to la
      belle Comtesse de Barnac."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is not it very extraordinary, he absolutely never spoke to me," said
      Dora: "a very strange manner of paying his court!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle assured Dora "that this was owing to M. de Connal's French
      habits. The young ladies in Paris passing for nothing, scarcely ever
      appearing in society till they are married, the gentlemen have no
      intercourse with them, and it would be considered as a breach of respect
      due to a young lady or her mother, to address much conversation to her.
      And you know, my dear Dore, their marriages are all make up by the father,
      the mother, the friends&mdash;the young people themselves never speak,
      never know nothing at all about each one another, till the contract is
      sign: in fact, the young lady is the little round what you call cipher,
      but has no value in socit at all, till the figure of de husband come to
      give it the value."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no notion of being a cipher," said Dora: "I am not a French young
      lady, Monsieur de Connal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but my dear Dore, consider what is de French wife! Ah! then come her
      great glory; then she reign over all hearts, and is in full libert to
      dress, to go, to come, to do what she like, with her own carriage, her own
      box at de opera, and&mdash;You listen well, and I shall draw all that out
      for you, from M. de Connal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora languidly, sullenly begged her aunt would not give herself the
      trouble&mdash;she had no curiosity. But nevertheless she asked several
      questions about la Comtesse de Barnac; and all the time saying she did not
      in the least care what he thought or said of her, she drew from her aunt
      every syllable that M. de Connal had uttered, and was secretly mortified
      and surprised to find he had said so little. She could not dress herself
      to her mind to-day, and protesting she did not care how she looked, she
      resigned herself into her aunt's hands. Whatever he might think, she
      should take care to show him at dinner that young ladies in this country
      were not ciphers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, however, as before, all Dora's preconcerted airs of disdain and
      determination to show that she was somebody, gave way, she did not know
      how, before M. de Connal's easy assurance and polite indifference. His
      knowledge of the world, and his talents for conversation, with the variety
      of subjects he had flowing in from all parts of the world, gave him
      advantages with which there was no possibility of contending.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked, and carved&mdash;all life, and gaiety, and fashion: he spoke of
      battles, of princes, plays, operas, wine, women, cardinals, religion,
      politics, poetry, and turkeys stuffed with truffles&mdash;and Paris for
      ever!&mdash;Dash on! at every thing!&mdash;hit or miss&mdash;sure of the
      applause of Mademoiselle&mdash;and, as he thought, secure of the
      admiration of the whole company of natives, from <i>le beau-pre</i>, at
      the foot of the table, to the boy who waited, or who did not wait,
      opposite to him, but who stood entranced with wonder at all that M. de
      Connal said, and all that he did&mdash;even to the fashion in which he
      stowed trusses of salad into his mouth with a fork, and talked&mdash;through
      it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dora, what did she think?&mdash;she thought she was very much
      mortified that there was room for her to say so little. The question now
      was not what she thought of M. de Connal, but what he thought of her.
      After beginning with various little mock defences, avertings of the head,
      and twists of the neck, of the shoulders and hips, compound motions
      resolvable into <i>mauvaise honte</i> and pride, as dinner proceeded, and
      Monsieur de Connal's <i>success</i> was undoubted, she silently gave up
      her resolution "not to admire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the first course was over, Connal perceived that he had her eye:
      "Before the second is over," thought he, "I shall have her ear; and by the
      time we come to the dessert, I shall be in a fair way for the heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he seemed to have talked without any design, except to amuse
      himself and the company in general, yet in all he had said there had been
      a prospective view to his object. He chose his means well, and in
      Mademoiselle he found, at once, a happy dupe and a confederate. Without
      previous concert, they raised visions of Parisian glory which were to
      prepare the young lady's imagination for a French lover or a French
      husband. M. de Connal was well aware that no matter who touched her heart,
      if he could pique her vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, when the ladies retired, old Mr. Connal began to enter upon
      the question of the intended union between the families&mdash;Ormond left
      the room, and Corny suppressed a deep sigh. M. de Connal took an early
      opportunity of declaring that there was no truth in the report of his
      going to be married in England: he confessed that such a thing had been in
      question&mdash;he must speak with delicacy&mdash;but the family and
      connexions did not suit him; he had a strong prejudice, he owned, in
      favour of ancient family&mdash;Irish family; he had always wished to marry
      an Irish woman&mdash;for that reason he had avoided opportunities that
      might have occurred of connecting himself, perhaps advantageously, in
      France; he was really ambitious of the honour of an alliance with the
      O'Shanes. Nothing could be more fortunate for him than the friendship
      which had subsisted between his father and Mr. O'Shane.&mdash;And the
      promise?&mdash;Relinquish it!&mdash;Oh! that, he assured Mr. O'Shane, was
      quite impossible, provided the young lady herself should not make a
      decided objection&mdash;he should abide by her decision&mdash;he could not
      possibly think of pressing his suit, if there should appear any
      repugnance: in that case, he should be infinitely mortified&mdash;he
      should be absolutely in despair; but he should know how to submit&mdash;cost
      him what it would: he should think, as a man of honour, it was his part to
      sacrifice his wishes, to what the young lady might conceive to be for her
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He added a profusion of compliments on the young lady's charms, with a
      declaration of the effect they had already produced on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all said with a sort of nonchalance, which Corny did not at all
      like. But Mademoiselle, who was summoned to Corny's private council, gave
      it as her opinion, that M. de Connal was already quite in love&mdash;quite
      as much as a French husband ever was. She was glad that her brother-in-law
      was bound by his promise to a gentleman who would really be a proper
      husband for her niece. Mademoiselle, in short, saw every thing <i>couleur
      de rose</i>; and she urged, that, since M. de Connal had come to Ireland
      for the express purpose of forwarding his present suit, he ought to be
      invited to stay at Corny Castle, that he might endeavour to make himself
      acceptable to Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Corny acceded. He left Mademoiselle to make the invitation; for,
      he said, she understood French politeness, and <i>all that</i>, better
      than he did. The invitation was made and accepted, with all due
      expressions of infinite delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear Harry Ormond," said Corny, the first moment he had an
      opportunity of speaking to Harry in private, "what do you think of this
      man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Miss O'Shane thinks of him is the question," said Harry, with some
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true&mdash;it was too hard to ask you. But I'll tell you what I
      think: between ourselves, Black Connal is better than White, inasmuch as a
      puppy is better than a brute. We shall see what Dora will say or think
      soon&mdash;the aunt is over head and ears already: women are mighty apt to
      be taken, one way or other, with a bit of a coxcomb. Vanity&mdash;vanity!
      but still I know&mdash;I suspect, Dora has a heart: from me, I hope, she
      has a right to a heart. But I will say no more till I see which way the
      heart turns and <i>settles</i>, after all the little tremblings and
      variations: when it points steady, I shall know how to steer my course. I
      have a scheme in my head, but I won't mention it to you, Harry, because it
      might end in disappointment: so go off to bed and to sleep, if you can;
      you have had a hard day to go through, my poor honourable Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      And poor honourable Harry had many hard days to go through. He had now to
      see how Dora's mind was gradually worked upon, not by a new passion, for
      Mr. Connal never inspired or endeavoured to inspire passion, but by her
      own and her aunt's vanity. Mademoiselle with constant importunity assailed
      her: and though Dora saw that her aunt's only wish was to settle in Paris,
      and to live in a fine hotel; and though Dora was persuaded, that for this,
      her aunt would without scruple sacrifice her happiness and that of Harry
      Ormond; yet she was so dazzled by the splendid representation of a
      Parisian life, as not to see very distinctly what object she had herself
      in view. Connal's flattery, too, though it had scarcely any pretence to
      the tone of truth or passion, yet contrasting with his previous
      indifference, gratified her. She was sensible that he was not attached to
      her as Harry Ormond was, but she flattered herself that she should quite
      turn his head in time. She tried all her power of charming for this
      purpose, at first chiefly with the intention of exciting Harry's jealousy,
      and forcing him to break his honourable resolution. Harry continued her
      first object for some little time, but soon the idea of piquing him was
      merely an excuse for coquetry. She imagined that she could recede or
      advance with her new admirer, just as she thought proper; but she was
      mistaken: she had now to deal with a man practised in the game: he might
      let her appear to win, but not for nothing would he let her win a single
      move; yet he seemed to play so carelessly, as not in the least to alarm,
      or put her on her guard. The bystanders began to guess how the game would
      terminate: it was a game in which the whole happiness of Dora's life was
      at stake, to say nothing of his own, and Ormond could not look on without
      anxiety&mdash;and, notwithstanding his outwardly calm appearance, without
      strong conflicting emotions. "If," said he to himself, "I were convinced
      that this man would make her happy, I think I could be happy myself." But
      the more he saw of Connal, the less he thought him likely to make Dora
      happy; unless, indeed, her vanity could quite extinguish her sensibility:
      then, Monsieur de Connal would be just the husband to suit her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal was exactly what he appeared to be&mdash;a gay young officer, who
      had made his own way up in the world&mdash;a petit-matre, who had really
      lived in good company at Paris, and had made himself agreeable to women of
      rank and fortune. He might, perhaps, as he said, with his figure, and
      fashion, and connexions, have made his fortune in Paris by marriage, had
      he had time to look about him&mdash;but a sudden run of ill-fortune at
      play had obliged him to quit Paris for a season. It was necessary to make
      his fortune by marriage in England or Ireland, and as expeditiously as
      possible. In this situation, Dora, with her own and her aunt's property,
      was, as he considered it, an offer not to be rashly slighted; nor yet was
      he very eager about the matter&mdash;if he failed here, he should succeed
      elsewhere. This real indifference gave him advantages with Dora, which a
      man of feeling would perhaps never have obtained, or never have kept. Her
      father, though he believed in the mutable nature of woman, yet could
      scarcely think that his daughter Dora was of this nature. He could
      scarcely conceive that her passion for Harry Ormond&mdash;that passion
      which had, but a short time before, certainly affected her spirits, and
      put him in fear for her health&mdash;could have been conquered by a
      coxcomb, who cared very little whether he conquered or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was this possible? Good Corny invented many solutions of the problem:
      he fancied one hour that his daughter was sacrificing herself from duty to
      him, or complaisance to her aunt; the next hour, he settled, and with more
      probability, that she was piqued by Harry Ormond's not showing more
      passion. King Corny was resolved to know distinctly how the matter really
      was: he therefore summoned his daughter and aunt into his presence, and
      the person he sent to summon them was Harry Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back with them, yourself, Harry&mdash;I shall want you also."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry returned with both the ladies. By the countenance of Cornelius
      O'Shane, they all three augured that he had something of importance to
      say, and they stood in anxious expectation. He went to the point
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dora, I know it is the custom on some occasions for ladies never to tell
      the truth&mdash;therefore I shall not ask any question that I think will
      put your truth to the test. I shall tell you my mind, and leave you to
      judge for yourself. Take as long or as short a time to know your own mind
      as you please&mdash;only know it clearly, and send me your answer by your
      aunt. All I beg is, that when the answer shall be delivered to me, this
      young man may be by. Don't interrupt me, Dora&mdash;I have a high opinion
      of him," said he, keeping his eye upon Dora's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a great esteem, affection, love for him:" he pronounced the words
      deliberately, that he might see the effect on Dora; but her countenance
      was as undecided as her mind&mdash;no judgment could be formed from its
      changes. "I wish Harry Ormond," continued he, "to know all my conduct: he
      knows that, long ago, I made a foolish promise to give my daughter to a
      man I knew nothing about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was going to interrupt, but Cornelius O'Shane silenced her.
      "Mademoiselle&mdash;sister O'Faley, I will do the best I can to repair
      that folly&mdash;and to leave you at liberty, Dora, to follow the choice
      of your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and again studied her countenance, which was agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her choice is your choice&mdash;her father's choice is always the choice
      of the good daughter," said Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe she is a good daughter, and that is the particular reason I am
      determined to be as good a father as I can to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora wept in silence&mdash;and Mademoiselle, a good deal alarmed, wanted
      to remove Harry Ormond out of the young lady's sight: she requested him to
      go to her apartment for a smelling-bottle for her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said King Corny, "go yourself, sister O'Faley, if you like it,
      but I'll not let Harry Ormond stir&mdash;he is my witness present. Dora is
      not fainting&mdash;if you would only let her alone, she would do well.
      Dora, listen to me: if you don't really prefer this Black Connal for a
      husband to all other men, as you are to swear at the altar you do, if you
      marry him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora was strongly affected by the solemn manner of her father's appeal to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If," continued her father, "you are not quite clear, my dear child, that
      you prefer him to other men, do not marry him. I have a notion I can bring
      you off without breaking my word: listen. I would willingly give half my
      fortune to secure your happiness, my darling. If I do not mistake him, Mr.
      Connal would, for a less sum, give me back my promise, and give you up
      altogether, my dear Dora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora's tears stopped, Mademoiselle's exclamations poured forth, and they
      both declared they were certain that Mr. Connal would not, for any thing
      upon earth that could be offered to him, give up the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corny said he was willing to make the trial, if they pleased. Mademoiselle
      seemed to hesitate; but Dora eagerly accepted the proposal, thanked her
      father for his kindness, and declared that she should be happy to have,
      and to abide by, this test of Mr. Connal's love. If he were so base as to
      prefer half her fortune to herself, she should, she said, think herself
      happy in having escaped from such a traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora's pride was wakened, and she now spoke in a high tone: she always,
      even in the midst of her weaknesses, had an ambition to show spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will put the test to him myself, within this hour," said Corny; "and
      before you go to bed this night, when the clock strikes twelve, all three
      of you be on this spot, and I will give you his answer. But stay, Harry
      Ormond, we have not had your opinion&mdash;would you advise me to make
      this trial?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if I should lose half of Dora's fortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would think it well bestowed, I am sure, sir, in securing her from an
      unhappy marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then she might not, perhaps, so easily find another lover with half a
      fortune&mdash;that might make a difference, hey, Harry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, I should think, sir, that it could make the least difference
      in the affection of any one who really&mdash;who was really worthy of Miss
      O'Shane."
    </p>
    <p>
      The agitation into which Harry Ormond was thrown, flattered and touched
      Dora for the moment; her aunt hurried her out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius O'Shane rang, and inquired where Mr. Connal was? In his own
      apartment, writing letters, his servant believed. O'Shane sent to beg to
      see him, as soon as he was at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve o'clock Dora, Mademoiselle, and Ormond, were all in the study,
      punctually as the clock was striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is M. de Connal's answer?" cried Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he hesitate, my dear Dore, give him up dat minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," said Dora: "I have too much spirit to do otherwise. What's
      his answer, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His answer, my dear child, has proved that you knew him better than I did&mdash;he
      scorns the offer of half your fortune&mdash;for your whole fortune he
      would not give you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so," cried Dora, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so," echoed Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did him injustice," cried Ormond. "I am glad that M. de Connal has
      proved himself worthy of you, Dora, since you really approve of him&mdash;you
      have not a friend in the world, next to your father, who wishes your
      happiness more sincerely than I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a heart for you!" said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for me," said Mademoiselle: "he has no passion in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you joy, Dora," said her father. "I own I misjudged the man&mdash;on
      account of his being a bit of a coxcomb. But if you can put up with that,
      so will I&mdash;when I have done a man injustice, I will make it up to him
      every way I can. Now let him, he has my consent, be as great a coxcomb as
      ever wore red heels. I'll put up with it all, since he really loves my
      child. I did not think he would have stood the test."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor would he, had not he been properly prepared by Mademoiselle&mdash;she
      had, before M. de Connal went to Corny, sent him a little billet, which
      told him the test that would be proposed, and thus prevented all
      possibility of her dear niece's being disappointed in her lover or her
      husband.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Vain of showing that he was not in the slightest degree jealous, Connal
      talked to Ormond in the freest manner imaginable, touching with
      indifference even on the very subject which Ormond, from feelings of
      delicacy and honour, had anxiously avoided. Connal seemed to be perfectly
      aware how matters had stood before his arrival between Dora and our young
      hero. "It was all very well," he said, "quite natural&mdash;in the common
      course of things&mdash;impossible it should have been otherwise. A young
      woman, who saw no one else, must inevitably fall in love with the first
      agreeable young man who made love to her, or who did not make love to her&mdash;it
      was quite equal to him which. He had heard wonders from his father-in-law
      elect on that last topic, and he was willing to oblige him, or any other
      gentleman or lady, by believing miracles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, extremely embarrassed by the want of delicacy and feeling with
      which this polished coxcomb spoke, had, however, sufficient presence of
      mind to avoid, either by word or look, making any particular application
      of what was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have really prodigious presence of mind, and <i>discretion</i>, and
      <i>tact</i>, for a young man who has, I presume, had so little practice in
      these affairs," said Connal; "but don't constrain yourself longer. I speak
      frankly to take off all embarrassment on your part&mdash;you see there
      exists none on mine&mdash;never, for a moment: no, how can it possibly
      signify," continued he, "to any man of common sense, who, or what a woman
      liked before she saw him? You don't think a man, who has seen any thing of
      the world, would trouble himself to inquire whether he was, or was not,
      the first love of the woman he is going to marry. To <i>marry</i>&mdash;observe
      the emphasis&mdash;distinguish&mdash;distinguish, and seriously let us
      calculate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond gave no interruption to his calculations, and the petit-matre, in
      a tone of philosophic fatuity, asked, "Of the numbers of your English or
      Irish wives&mdash;all excellent&mdash;how many, I pray you, do you
      calculate are now married to the man they first, <i>fell in love with</i>,
      as they call it? My good sir, not five per cent., depend on it. The thing
      is morally impossible, unless girls are married out of a convent, as with
      us in France, and very difficult even then; and after all, what are the
      French husbands the better for it? I understand English husbands think
      themselves best off. I don't pretend to judge; but they seem to prefer
      what they call domestic happiness to the French <i>esprit de socit</i>.
      Still, this may be prejudice of education&mdash;of country: each nation
      has its taste. Every thing is for the best in this world, for people who
      know how to make the best of it. You would not think, to look at me, I was
      so philosophic: but even in the midst of my military career I have thought&mdash;thought
      profoundly. Every body in France <i>thinks</i> now," said M. de Connal,
      taking a pinch of snuff with a very pensive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Every body</i> in France <i>thinks</i> now!" repeated Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every man of a certain rank, that is to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is to say, of your rank," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I don't give myself as an example; but&mdash;you may judge&mdash;I
      own I am surprised to find myself philosophizing here in the Black Islands&mdash;but
      one philosophizes every where." "And you would have more time for it here,
      I should suppose, than in Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time, my dear sir&mdash;no such thing! Time is merely in idea; but <i>Tais-toi
      Jean Jacques! Tais-toi Condillac!</i> To resume the chain of our reasoning&mdash;love
      and marriage&mdash;I say it all comes to much the same thing in France and
      in these countries&mdash;after all. There is more gallantry, perhaps,
      before marriage in England, more after marriage in France&mdash;which has
      the better bargain? I don't pretend to decide. Philosophic doubt for me,
      especially in cases where 'tis not worth while to determine; but I see I
      astonish you, Mr. Ormond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do, indeed," said Ormond, ingenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you joy&mdash;I envy you," said M. de Connal, sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After a certain age, if one lives in the world, one can't be astonished&mdash;that's
      a lost pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me who have lived out of the world it is a pleasure, or rather a
      sensation&mdash;I am not sure whether I should call it a pleasure&mdash;that
      is not likely to be soon exhausted," said Ormond. "A sensation! and you
      are not sure whether you should call it a pleasure. Do you know you've a
      genius for metaphysics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" exclaimed Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! now I have astonished you again. Good! whether pleasurable or not,
      trust me, nothing is so improving to a young man as to be well astonished.
      Astonishment I conceive to be a sort of mental electric shock&mdash;electric
      fire; it opens at once and enlightens the understanding: and really you
      have an understanding so well worth enlightening&mdash;I do assure you,
      that your natural acuteness will, whenever and wherever you appear, make
      you <i>un homme marquant."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! spare me, Mr. Connal," said Ormond. "I am not used to French
      compliment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, upon my honour, without compliment, in all English <i>bonhommie</i>,"
      (laying his hand upon his heart)&mdash;"upon the honour of a gentleman,
      your remarks have sometimes perfectly astonished me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really!" said Ormond; "but I thought you had lived so much in the world,
      you could not be astonished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so, I own," said Connal; "but it was reserved for M. Ormond to
      convince me of my mistake, to revive an old pleasure&mdash;more difficult
      still than to invent a new one! In recompense I hope I give you some new
      ideas&mdash;just throw out opinions for you. Accept&mdash;reject&mdash;reject
      now&mdash;accept an hour, a year hence, perhaps&mdash;just as it strikes&mdash;merely
      materials for thinking, I give you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Ormond; "and be assured they are not lost upon me. You
      have given me a great deal to think of seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Seriously</i>!&mdash;no; that's your fault, your national fault.
      Permit me: what you want chiefly in conversation&mdash;in every thing, is
      a certain degree of&mdash;of&mdash;you have no English word&mdash;<i>lightness</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Lgret</i>, perhaps you mean," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely. I forgot you understood French so well. <i>Lgret</i>&mdash;untranslatable!&mdash;You
      seize my idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Ormond, as he fancied, in admiration of the man who, in his own
      opinion, possessed the whole theory and practice of the art of pleasing,
      and the science of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal's conversation and example might have produced a great effect
      on the mind of a youth of Ormond's strong passions, lively imagination,
      and total ignorance of the world, if he had met this brilliant officer in
      different society. Had he seen Connal only as a man shining in company, or
      considered him merely as a companion, he must have been dazzled by his
      fashion, charmed by his gaiety, and <i>imposed</i> upon by his decisive
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had such a vision lighted on the Black Islands, and appeared to our hero
      suddenly, in any other circumstances but those in which it did appear, it
      might have struck and overawed him; and without inquiring "whether from
      heaven or hell," he might have followed wherever it led or pointed the
      way. But in the form of a triumphant rival&mdash;without delicacy, without
      feeling, neither deserving nor loving the woman he had won&mdash;not
      likely to make Dora happy&mdash;almost certain to make her father
      miserable&mdash;there was no danger that Black Connal could ever obtain
      any ascendancy over Ormond; on the contrary, Connal was useful in forming
      our hero's character. The electric shock of astonishment did operate in a
      salutary manner in opening Harry's understanding: the materials for
      thinking were not thrown away: he <i>did</i> think&mdash;even in the Black
      Islands; and in judging of Connal's character, he made continual progress
      in forming his own: he had motive for exercising his judgment&mdash;he was
      anxious to study the man's character on Dora's account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his unpolished friend, old Corny, and this finished young man of
      the world, in daily contrast, Ormond had occasion to compare the real and
      the factitious, both in matter and manner: he distinguished, and felt
      often acutely, the difference between that politeness of the heart, which
      respects and sympathizes with the feelings of others, and that
      conventional politeness, which is shown merely to gratify the vanity of
      him by whom it is displayed. In the same way he soon discriminated, in
      conversation, between Corny's power of original thinking, and M. de
      Connal's knack of throwing old thoughts into new words; between the power
      of answering an argument, and the art of evading it by a repartee. But it
      was chiefly in comparing different ideas of happiness and modes of life,
      that our young hero's mind was enlarged by Connal's conversation&mdash;whilst
      the comparison he secretly made between this polished gentleman's
      principles and his own, was always more satisfactory to his pride of
      virtue, than Connal's vanity could have conceived to be possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day some conversation passed between Connal and <i>his father-in-law
      elect</i>, as he now always called him, upon his future plans of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Corny said he did not know how to hope that, during the few years he
      had to live, Connal would not think of taking his daughter from him to
      Paris, as, from some words that had dropped from Mademoiselle, he had
      reason to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Connal said, "he had formed no such cruel intention: the Irish half
      of Mademoiselle must have blundered on this occasion. He would do his
      utmost, if he could with honour, to retire from the service; unless the
      service imperiously called him away, he should settle in Ireland: he
      should make it a point even, independently of his duty to his own father,
      not to take Miss O'Shane from her country and her friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      The father, open-hearted and generous himself, was fond to believe what he
      wished: and confiding in these promises, the old man forgave all that he
      did not otherwise approve of in his future son-in-law, and thanked him
      almost with tears in his eyes; still repeating, as his natural penetration
      remonstrated against his credulity, "But I could hardly have believed this
      from such a young man as you, Captain Connal. Indeed, how you could ever
      bring yourself to think of settling in retirement is wonderful to me; but
      love does mighty things, brings about great changes."
    </p>
    <p>
      French commonplaces of sentiment upon love, and compliments on Dora's
      charms and his own sensibility, were poured out by Connal, and the father
      left the room satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal then, throwing himself back in his chair, burst out a laughing, and
      turning to Ormond, the only person in the room, said, "Could you have
      conceived this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Conceived what, sir?" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Conceived this King Corny's capacity for belief? What!&mdash;believe that
      I will settle in his Black Islands!&mdash;I!&mdash;As well believe me to
      be half marble, half man, like <i>the unfortunate</i> in the Black Islands
      of the Arabian Tales. Settle in the Black Islands!&mdash;No: could you
      conceive a man on earth could be found so simple as to credit such a
      thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is another man on earth who was simple enough to believe it," said
      Ormond, "and to give you credit for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" cried Connal&mdash;"That's too much!&mdash;Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when you said it&mdash;when I heard you promise it to Mr. O'Shane&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mercy!&mdash;Don't kill me with laughing!" said he, laughing
      affectedly: "Oh! that face of yours&mdash;there is no standing it. You
      heard me <i>promise</i>&mdash;and the accent on <i>promise</i>. Why, even
      women, now-a-days, don't lay such an emphasis on <i>a promise</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, I suppose, depends on who gives it." said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather on who receives it," said Connal: "but look here, you who
      understand the doctrine of promises, tell me what a poor conscientious man
      must do who has two pulling him different ways?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A conscientious man cannot have given two diametrically opposite
      promises."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Diametrically</i>!&mdash;Thank you for that word&mdash;it just saves
      my lost conscience. Commend me always to an epithet in the last resource
      for giving one latitude of conscience in these nice cases&mdash;I have not
      given two diametrically opposite&mdash;no, I have only given four that
      cross one another. One to your King Corny; another to my angel, Dora;
      another to the dear aunt; and a fourth to my dearer self. First promise to
      King Corny, to settle in the Black Islands; a gratuitous promise,
      signifying nothing&mdash;read Burlamaqui: second promise to Mademoiselle,
      to go and live with her at Paris; with <i>her</i>&mdash;on the face of it
      absurd! a promise extorted too under fear of my life, of immediate peril
      of being talked to death&mdash;see Vatel on extorted promises&mdash;void:
      third promise to my angel, Dora, to live wherever she pleases; but that's
      a lover's promise, made to be broken&mdash;see Love's Calendar, or, if you
      prefer the bookmen's authority, I don't doubt that, under the head of
      promises made when a man is not in his right senses, some of those learned
      fellows in wigs would bring me off <i>sain et sauf</i>: but now for my
      fourth promise&mdash;I am a man of honour&mdash;when I make a promise
      intending to keep it, no man so scrupulous; all promises made to myself
      come under this head; and I have promised myself to live, and make my wife
      live, wherever I please, or not to live with her at all. This promise I
      shall bold sacred. Oblige me with a smile, Mr. Ormond&mdash;a smile of
      approbation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Mr. Connal, that is impossible&mdash;I am sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I, and sincerely you are too romantic. See things as they are, as a
      man of the world, I beseech you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not a man of the world, and I thank God for it," cried Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank your God for what you please," said Connal; "but in disdaining to
      be a man of the world, you will not, I hope, refuse to let me think you a
      man of common sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think what you please of me," said Ormond, rather haughtily; "what I
      think of myself is the chief point with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will lose this little brusquerie of manner," said Connal, "when you
      have mixed more with mankind. Providentially, we are all made dependent on
      one another's good opinion. Even I, you see, cannot live without yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether from vanity, from the habit of wishing to charm every body in
      every house he entered, especially any one who made resistance; or whether
      he was piqued and amused with Ormond's frank and natural character, and
      determined to see how far he could urge him, Connal went on, though our
      young hero gave him no encouragement to hope that he should win his good
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Candidly," said he, "put yourself in my place for a moment: I was in
      England, following my own projects; I was not in love with the girl as you&mdash;well,
      pardon&mdash;as anybody might have been&mdash;but I was at a distance,
      that makes all the difference: I am sent for over by two fathers, and I am
      told that in consequence of my good or evil fortune in being born a twin,
      and of some inconceivable promise between two Irish fathers over a
      punch-bowl, I am to have the refusal, I should rather say the acceptance,
      of a very pretty girl with a very pretty fortune. Now, except just at the
      moment when the overture reached me, it could not have been listened to
      for a moment by such a man as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insufferable coxcomb," said Ormond to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, to answer a question, which I omitted to answer just now to my
      father-in-law,&mdash;what could induce me to come over and think of
      settling in the Black Islands? I answer&mdash;for I am determined to win
      your confidence by my candour&mdash;I answer in one word, <i>un billard</i>&mdash;a
      billiard-table. To tell you all, I confess&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess nothing, I beg, Mr. Connal, to me, that you do not wish to be
      known to Mr. O'Shane: I am his friend&mdash;he is my benefactor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not repeat&mdash;you are a gentleman, and a man of honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am; and as such I desire, on this occasion, not to hear what I ought
      neither to repeat nor to keep secret. It is my duty not to leave my
      benefactor in the dark as to any point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! come&mdash;come," interrupted Connal, "we had better not take it on
      this serious tone, lest, if we begin to talk of duty, we should presently
      conceive it to be our duty to run one another through the body, which
      would be no pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No pleasure," said Ormond; "but if it became a duty, I hope, on all
      occasions, I should be able to do whatever I thought a duty. Therefore to
      avoid any misunderstanding, Mr. Connal, let me beg that you will not
      honour me farther with your confidence. I cannot undertake to be the
      confidant of any one, of whom I have never professed myself to be the
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ca suffit," said Connal, lightly. "We understand one another now
      perfectly'&mdash;you shall in future play the part of <i>prince</i>, and
      not of confidant. Pardon me, I forgot your highness's pretensions;" so
      saying, he gaily turned on his heel, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time forward little conversation passed between Mr. Connal and
      Ormond&mdash;little indeed between Ormond and Dora. With Mademoiselle,
      Ormond had long ceased to be a favourite, and even her loquacity now
      seldom addressed itself to him. He was in a painful situation;&mdash;he
      spent as much of his time as he could at the farm his friend had given
      him. As soon as O'Shane found that there was no truth in the report of
      Black Connal's intended marriage in England, that he claimed in earnest
      his promise of his daughter, and that Dora herself inclined to the new
      love, his kind heart felt for poor Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he did not know all that had passed, yet he saw the awkwardness and
      difficulty of Ormond's present situation, and, whatever it might cost him
      to part with his young friend, with his adopted son, Corny determined not
      to detain him longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry Ormond, my boy," said he to him one day, "time for you to see
      something of the world, also for the world to see something of you; I've
      kept you here for my own pleasure too long: as long as I had any hope of
      settling you as I wished 'twas a sufficient excuse to myself; but now I
      have none left&mdash;I must part with you: and so, by the blessing, God
      helping me to conquer my selfishness, and the yearnings of my heart
      towards you, I will. I mean," continued he, "to send you far from me&mdash;to
      banish you for your good from the Black Islands entirely. Nay, don't you
      interrupt me, nor say a word; for if you do, I shall be too soft to have
      the heart to do you justice. You know you said yourself, and I felt it for
      you, that it was best you should leave this. Well, I have been thinking of
      you ever since, and licking different projects into shape for you&mdash;listening
      too to every thing Connal threw out; but all he says that way is in the
      air&mdash;no substance, when you try to have and to hold&mdash;too full of
      himself, that youngster, to be a friend to another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no reason why he should be my friend, sir," said Ormond&mdash;"I
      do not pretend to be his; and I rejoice in not being under any obligations
      to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right!&mdash;and high!&mdash;just as I feel for you. After all, I approve
      of your own wish to go into the British service in preference to any
      foreign service, and you could not be of the Irish brigade&mdash;Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, I infinitely prefer," said Ormond, "the service of my own
      country&mdash;the service in which my father&mdash;I know nothing of my
      father, but I have always heard him spoken of as a good officer; I hope I
      shall not disgrace his name. The English service for me, sir, if you
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, I'm glad you see things as I do, and are not run away with by
      uniform, and <i>all that</i>. I have lodged the needful in the bank, to
      purchase a commission for you, my son. Now! no more go to thank me, if you
      love me, Harry, than you would your own father. I've written to a friend
      to choose a regiment in which there'd be as little danger as possible for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As little danger as possible!" repeated Harry, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Phoo! you don't think I mean as little danger of fighting. I would not
      wrong you so. No&mdash;but as little danger of gambling. Not that you're
      inclined to it, or any thing else that's bad&mdash;but there is no knowing
      what company might lead the best into; and it is my duty and inclination
      to look as close to all these things as if for my own son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My kind father&mdash;no father could be kinder," cried Harry, quite
      overpowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then you go as soon as the commission comes&mdash;that's settled; and
      I hope I shall be able to bear it, Harry, old as I am. There may perhaps
      be a delay of a little time longer than you could wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir, as long as you wish me to stay with you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a minute beyond what's necessary. I mention the cause of delay, that
      you may not think I'm dallying for my own sake. You remember General
      Albemarle, who came here one day last year&mdash;election time, canvassing&mdash;the
      general that had lost the arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly, sir, I remember your answer&mdash;'I will give my interest to
      this <i>empty sleeve</i>.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you&mdash;never a word lost upon you. Well, now I have hopes that
      this man&mdash;this general, will take you by the hand; for he has a hand
      left yet, and a powerful one to serve a friend; and I've requested him to
      keep his eye upon you, and I have asked his advice: so we can't stir till
      we get it, and that will be eight days, or ten, say. My boy, you must bear
      on as you are&mdash;we have the comfort of the workshop to ourselves, and
      some rational recreation; good shooting we will have soon too, for the
      first time this season."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the various circumstances which endeared Harry to our singular
      monarch, his skill and keenness as a sportsman were not inconsiderable: he
      knew where all the game in the island was to be found; so that, when his
      good old patron was permitted by the gout to take the field, Harry's
      assistance saved him a vast deal of unnecessary toil, and gratified him in
      his favourite amusement, whilst he, at the same time, sympathized in the
      sport. Corny, besides being a good shot, was an excellent mechanic: he
      beguiled the hours, when there was neither hunting nor shooting, in a
      workshop which was furnished with the best tools. Among the other
      occupations at the work-bench, he was particularly skilful in making and
      adjusting the locks of guns, and in boring and polishing the inside of
      their barrels to the utmost perfection: he had contrived and executed a
      tool for the enlarging the barrel of a gun in any particular part, so as
      to increase its effect in adding to the force of the discharge, and in
      preventing the shot from scattering too widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope of the success of his contrivance, and the prospect of going out
      with Harry on the approaching first of September, solaced King Corny, and
      seemed to keep up his spirits, through all the vexation he felt concerning
      Connal and this marriage, which evidently was not to his taste. It was to
      Dora's, however, and was becoming more evidently so every hour&mdash;and
      soon M. Connal pressed, and Mademoiselle urged, and Dora named&mdash;the
      happy day&mdash;and Mademoiselle, in transports, prepared to go to Dublin,
      with her niece, to choose the wedding-clothes, and, Connal to bespeak the
      equipages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was quick in her operations when dress was in question: the
      preparations for the delightful journey were soon made&mdash;the morning
      for their departure came&mdash;the carriage and horses were sent over the
      water early&mdash;and O'Shane and Harry afterwards accompanied the party
      in the boat to the other side of the lake, where the carriage waited with
      the door open. Connal, after handing in Mademoiselle, turned to look for
      his destined bride&mdash;who was taking leave of her father&mdash;Harry
      Ormond standing by. The moment she quitted her father's embrace, Father
      Jos poured with both his hands on her head the benedictions of all the
      saints. Released from Father Jos, Captain Connal hurried her on: Harry
      held out his hand to her as she passed. "Good bye, Dora&mdash;probably I
      shall never see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Harry!" said she, one touch of natural feeling stopping her short&mdash;"Oh,
      Harry!&mdash;Why?" Bursting into tears, she drew her hand from Connal, and
      gave it to Harry: Harry received the hand openly and cordially, shook it
      heartily, but took no advantage and no notice of the feelings by which he
      saw her at that moment agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Forgive</i>!" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good bye, <i>dear</i> Dora. God bless you&mdash;may you be as happy&mdash;half
      as happy, as I wish you to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure she will&mdash;happy as the day is long," said Mademoiselle,
      leaning out of the carriage: "why will you make her cry, Mr. Ormond,
      spoiling her eyes at parting? Come in to me&mdash;Dora, M. de Connal is
      waiting to hand you, mon enfant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is her dressing-box in, and all right?" asked Captain Connal, as he
      handed Dora into the carriage, who was still weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad compliment to M. de Connal, mon amie. Vrai scandale!" said
      Mademoiselle, pulling up the glass, while Dora sunk back in the carriage,
      sobbing without restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning," said Connal, who had now mounted his Mr. Ormond, "Adieu,
      Mr. Ormond&mdash;command me in any way you please. Drive on!"

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening after the departure of the happy trio, who were gone to Dublin
      to buy wedding-dresses, the party remaining at Castle Corny consisted only
      of King Corny, Ormond, and Father Jos. When the candles were lighted, his
      majesty gave a long and loud yawn, Harry set the backgammon table for him,
      and Father Jos, as usual, settled himself in the chimney corner; "And now
      Mademoiselle's gone," said he, "I shall take leave to indulge myself in my
      pipe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were on the continent this morning, Father Jos," said Cornelius. "Did
      ye learn any news for us? Size ace! that secures two points."
    </p>
    <p>
      "News! I did," said Father Jos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not tell it us, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not asked. You both seemed so wrapped up, I waited my time and
      opportunity. There's a new parson come to Castle Hermitage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What new person?" said King Corny. "Doublets, aces, Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A new parson I'm talking of," said Father Jos, "that has just got the
      living there; and they say Sir Ulick's mad about it, in Dublin, where he
      is still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mad!&mdash;Three men up&mdash;and you can't enter, Harry. Well, what is
      he mad about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because of the presentation to the living," replied the priest, "which
      government wouldn't make him a compliment of, as he expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is always expecting compliments from government," said Corny, "and
      always getting disappointments. Such throws as you have, Harry&mdash;Sixes!
      again&mdash;Well, what luck!&mdash;all over with me&mdash;It is only a hit
      at any rate! But what kind of man," continued he, "is this new clergyman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! them parsons is all one kind," said Father Jos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All one kind! No, no more than our own priests," said Corny. "There's
      good and bad, and all the difference in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know any thing at all about it," said Father Jos, sullenly; "but
      this I know, that no doubt he'll soon be over here, or his proctor,
      looking for the tithes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope we will have no quarrels," said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They ought to be abolished," said Father Jos, "the tithes, that is, I
      mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the quarrels, too, I hope," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! It's not our fault if there's quarrels," said Father Jos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faults on both sides generally in all quarrels," said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In lay quarrels, like enough," said Father Jos. "In church quarrels, it
      don't become a good Catholic to say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>That</i>," said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which?" said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That which you said, that there's faults on both sides; sure there's but
      one side, and that's our own side, can be in the right there can't be two
      <i>right sides</i>, can there? and consequently I there won't be two wrong
      sides, will there?&mdash;Ergo, there cannot, by a parity of rasoning, be
      two sides in the wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Harry, I'll take the black men now, and gammon you," said Corny.
      "Play away, man&mdash;what are you thinking of? is it of what Father Jos
      said? 'tis beyond the limits of the human understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos puffed away at his pipe for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was tired and ashamed of all the wrangling for two-pence with the last
      man," said King Corny, "and I believe I was sometimes too hard and too hot
      myself; but if this man's a gentleman, I think we shall agree. Did you
      hear his name, or any thing at all about him, Father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is one of them refugee families, the Huguenots, banished France by the
      adict of Nantz, they say, and his name's Cambray."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cambray!" exclaimed Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very good name," said O'Shane; "but what do you know of it, Harry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, sir, I happened to meet with a Dr. Cambray the winter I was in
      Dublin, whom I thought a very agreeable, respectable, amiable man&mdash;and
      I wonder whether this is the same person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something more now, Harry Ormond, I know by your face," said
      Corny: "there's some story of or belonging to Dr. Cambray&mdash;what is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No story, only a slight circumstance&mdash;which, if you please, I'd
      rather not tell you, sir," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is something very extraordinary, and looks mysterious," said Father
      Jos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing mysterious, I assure you," said Ormond,&mdash;"a mere trifle,
      which, if it concerned only myself, I would tell directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him alone, father," said King Corny; "I am sure he has a good reason&mdash;and
      I'm not curious: only let me whisper this in your ear to show you my own
      penetration, Harry&mdash;I'd lay my life" (said he, stretching over and
      whispering), "I'd lay my life Miss Annaly has something to do with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Annaly!&mdash;nothing in the world&mdash;only&mdash;yes, I recollect
      she was present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now&mdash;would not any body think I'm a conjuror? a physiognomist
      is cousin to (and not twice removed from) a conjuror."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I assure you, though you happened to guess right partly as to her
      being present, you are totally mistaken, sir, as to the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harry, <i>totally</i> means <i>wholly</i>: if I'm right in a
      part, I can't be mistaken in the whole. I am glad to make you smile, any
      way&mdash;and I wish I was right altogether, and that you was as rich as
      Croesus into the bargain; but stay a bit, if you come home a hero from the
      wars&mdash;that may do&mdash;ladies are mighty fond of heroes."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Ormond assured his good old imaginative friend that he
      was upon a wrong scent. Cornelius stopped to humour him; but was convinced
      that he was right: then turned to the still smoking Father Jos, and went
      on asking questions about Dr. Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing at all about him," said Father Jos, "but this, that Father
      M'Cormuck has dined with him, if I'm not misinformed, oftener than I think
      becoming in these times&mdash;making too free! And in the chapel last
      Sunday, I hear he made a very extraordinary address to his flock&mdash;there
      was one took down the words, and handed them to me: after remarking on the
      great distress of the season&mdash;first and foremost about the keeping of
      fast days the year&mdash;he allowed the poor of his flock, which is almost
      all, to eat meat whenever offered to them, because, said he, many would
      starve&mdash;now mark the obnoxious word&mdash;'if it was not for their
      benevolent Protestant neighbours, who make soup and broth for them.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there obnoxious in that?" said Cornelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till you hear the end&mdash;'and feed and clothe the distressed.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not obnoxious either, I hope," said Ormond, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young gentleman, you belong to the establishment, and are no judge in
      this case, permit me to remark," said Father Jos; "and I could wish Mr.
      O'Shane would hear to the end, before he joins in a Protestant laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard of a 'Protestant wind' before," said Harry, "but not of a
      Protestant laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm serious, Father Jos," said Corny; "let me hear to the end what
      makes your face so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And, I am sorry to say, show more charity to them than their own people,
      the rich Catholics, sometimes do.' If that is not downright slander, I
      don't know what is," said Father Jos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure it is not truth, Father?" said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if it was, even, so much the worse, to be telling it in the chapel,
      and to his flock&mdash;very improper in a priest, very extraordinary
      conduct!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos worked himself up to a high pitch of indignation, and railed
      and smoked for some time, while O'Shane and Ormond joined in defending
      M'Cormuck, and his address to his flock&mdash;and even his dining with the
      new clergyman of the parish. Father Jos gave up and had his punch. The
      result of the&mdash;whole was, that Ormond proposed to pay his respects
      the next morning to Dr. Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very proper," said O'Shane: "do so&mdash;fit you should&mdash;you are of
      his people, and you are acquainted with the gentleman&mdash;and I'd have
      you go and show yourself safe to him, that we've made no tampering with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos could not say so much, therefore he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Shane continued, "A very exact church-goer at the little church there
      you've always been, at the other side of the lake&mdash;never hindered&mdash;make
      what compliment you will proper for me&mdash;say I'm too old and clumsy
      for morning visitings, and never go out of my islands. But still I can
      love my neighbour in or out of them, and hope, in the name of peace, to be
      on good terms. Sha'n't be my fault if them tithes come across. Then I wish
      that bone of contention was from between the two churches. Meantime, I'm
      not snarling, if others is not craving: and I'd wish for the look of it,
      for your sake, Harry, that it should be all smooth; so say any thing you
      will for me to this Dr. Cambray,&mdash;though we are of a different faith,
      I should do any thing in rason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rason! what's that about rason?" said Father Jos: "I hope faith comes
      before rason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And after it, too, I hope, Father," said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos finished his punch, and went to sleep upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, next morning, paid his visit&mdash;Dr. Cambray was not at home;
      but Harry was charmed with the neatness of his house, and with the amiable
      and happy appearance of his family. He had never before seen Mrs. Cambray
      or her daughters, though he had met the doctor in Dublin. The circumstance
      which Harry had declined mentioning, when Corny questioned him about his
      acquaintance with Dr. Cambray, was very slight, though Father Jos had
      imagined it to be of mysterious importance. It had happened, that among
      the dissipated set of young men with whom Marcus O'Shane and Harry had
      passed that winter in Dublin, a party had one Sunday gone to hear the
      singing at the Asylum, and had behaved in a very unbecoming manner during
      the service. Dr. Cambray preached&mdash;he spoke to the young gentlemen
      afterwards with mild but becoming dignity. Harry Ormond instantly,
      sensible of his error, made proper apologies, and erred no farther. But
      Marcus O'Shane in particular, who was not accustomed to endure anything,
      much less any person, that crossed his humour, spoke of Dr. Cambray
      afterwards with vindictive bitterness, and with all his talents of mimicry
      endeavoured to make him ridiculous. Harry defended him with a warmth of
      ingenuous eloquence which did him honour; and with truth, courage, and
      candour, that did him still more, corrected some of Marcus's
      mis-statements, declaring that they had all been much to blame. Lady
      Annaly and her daughter were present, and this was one of the
      circumstances to which her ladyship had alluded, when she said that some
      things had occurred that had prepossessed her with a favourable opinion of
      Ormond's character. Dr. Cambray knew nothing of the attack or the defence
      till some time afterwards; and it was now so long ago, and Harry was so
      much altered since that time, that it was scarcely to be expected the
      doctor should recollect even his person. However, when Dr. Cambray came to
      the Black Islands to return his visit, he did immediately recognize
      Ormond, and seemed so much pleased with meeting him again, and so much
      interested about him, that Corny's warm heart was immediately won.
      Independently of this, the doctor's persuasive benevolent politeness could
      not have failed to operate, as it usually did, even on a first
      acquaintance, in pleasing and conciliating even those who were of opposite
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now," said Corny, when the doctor was gone, "there, now, is a
      sincere minister of the Gospel for you, and a polite gentleman into the
      bargain. Now that's politeness that does not trouble me&mdash;that's not
      for show&mdash;that's for <i>us</i>, not <i>himself</i>, mark!&mdash;and
      conversation! Why that man has conversation for the prince and the peasant&mdash;the
      courtier and the anchorite. Did not he find plenty for me, and got more
      out of me than I thought was in me&mdash;and the same if I'd been a monk
      of La Trappe, he would have made me talk like a pie. Now there's a man of
      the high world that the low world can like, very different from&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Corny paused, checked himself, and then resumed&mdash;"Principles,
      religion, and all no hinderance!&mdash;liberal and sincere too! Well, I
      only wish&mdash;Father Jos, no offence&mdash;I only wish, for Dr.
      Cambray's sake, and the Catholic church's sake, I was, for one day,
      Archbishop of Canterbury, or Primate of all Ireland, or whatever else
      makes the bishops in your church, and I'd skip over dean and archdeacon,
      and all, and make that man&mdash;clean a bishop before night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry smiled, and wished he had the power as well as the good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos said, "A man ought to be ashamed not to think of his <i>own</i>
      first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Harry, don't think I'd make a bishop lightly," continued King Corny;
      "I would not&mdash;I've been a king too long for that; and though only a
      king of my own fashion, I know what's fit for governing a country, observe
      me!&mdash;Cousin Ulick would make a job of a bishop, but I would not&mdash;nor
      I wouldn't to please my fancy. Now don't think I'd make that man a bishop
      just because he noticed and praised my gimcracks and inventions, and <i>substitutes</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos smiled, and demurely abased his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! then you don't know me as well as you think you do, father," said
      O'Shane. "Nor what's more, Harry, not his noting down the two regiments to
      make inquiry for friends for you, Harry, shouldn't have bribed me to
      partiality&mdash;though I could have kissed his shoe-ties for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy on you!" said Father Jos: "this doctor has bewitched you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you mind, then," persisted Corny, "the way he spoke of that
      cousin of mine, Sir Ulick, who he saw I did not like, and who has been, as
      you tell us, bitter against him, and even against his getting the living.
      Well, the way this Doctor Cambray spoke then pleased me&mdash;good morals
      without preaching&mdash;there's <i>do good to your enemies</i>&mdash;the
      true Christian doctrine&mdash;and the hardest point. Oh! let Father Jos
      say what he will, there's the man will be in heaven before many&mdash;heretic
      or no heretic, Harry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Jos shrugged up his shoulders, and then fixing the glass in his
      spectacles, replied, "We shall see better when we come to the tithes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," said Corny.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked off to his workshop, and took down his fowling-piece to put the
      finishing stroke to his work for the next day, which was to be the first
      day of partridge-shooting: he looked forward with delight&mdash;anticipating
      the gratification he should have in going out shooting with Harry, and
      trying his new fowling-piece. "But I won't go out to-morrow till the post
      has come in; for my mind couldn't enjoy the sport till I was satisfied
      whether the answer could come about your commission, Harry: my mind
      misgives me&mdash;that is, my calculation tells me, that it will come
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Corny's calculations were just: the next morning the little post-boy
      brought answers to various letters which he had written about Ormond&mdash;one
      to Ormond from Sir Ulick O'Shane, repeating his approbation of his ward's
      going into the army, approving of all the steps Cornelius had taken&mdash;especially
      of his intention of paying for the commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All's well," Cornelius said. The next letter was from Cornelius's banker,
      saying that the five hundred pound was lodged, ready. "All well." The
      army-agent wrote, "that he had commissions in two different regiments,
      waiting Mr. O'Shane's choice and orders per return of post, to purchase <i>in
      conformity</i>."&mdash;"That's all well." General Albemarle's answer to
      Mr. O'Shane's letter was most satisfactory: in terms that were not merely
      <i>officially</i> polite, but kind, "he assured Mr. O'Shane that he
      should, as far as it was in his power, pay attention to the young
      gentleman, whom Mr. O'Shane had so strongly recommended to his care, and
      by whose appearance and manner the general said he had been prepossessed,
      when he saw him some months ago at Corny Castle. There was a commission
      vacant in his son's regiment, which he recommended to Mr. Ormond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very thing I could have wished for you, my dear boy&mdash;you shall
      go off the day after to-morrow&mdash;not a moment's delay&mdash;I'll
      answer the letters this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harry reminded him that the post did not go out till the next day, and
      urged him not to lose this fine day&mdash;this first day of the season for
      partridge shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time enough for my business after we come home&mdash;the post does not go
      out till morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true: come off, then&mdash;let's enjoy the fine day sent us; and
      my gun, too&mdash;I forgot; for I do believe, Harry, I love you better
      even than my gun," said the warm-hearted Corny. "Call <i>Ormond</i>.
      Moriarty; let us have him with us&mdash;he'll enjoy it beyond all: one of
      the last day's shooting with his own Prince Harry!&mdash;but, poor fellow,
      we'll not tell him that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty and the dogs were summoned, and the fineness of the day, and the
      promise of good sport, put Moriarty in remarkably good spirits. By degrees
      King Corny's own spirits rose, and he forgot that it was the last day with
      Prince Harry, and he enjoyed the sport. After various trials of his new
      fowling-piece, both the king and the prince agreed that it succeeded to
      admiration. But even in the midst of his pride in his success, and his joy
      in the sport, his superior fondness for Harry prevailed, and showed itself
      in little, almost delicate instances of kindness, which could hardly have
      been expected from his unpolished mind. As they crossed a bog, he stooped
      every now and then, and plucked different kinds of bog-plants and heaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Harry," said he, "mind these for Dr. Cambray. Remember yesterday
      his mentioning that a daughter of his was making a botanical collection,
      and there's Sheelah can tell you all the Irish names and uses. Some I can
      note for you myself; and here, this minute&mdash;by great luck! the very
      thing he wanted!&mdash;the andromeda, I'll swear to it: throw away all and
      keep this&mdash;carry it to her to-morrow&mdash;for I will have you make a
      friend of that Dr. Cambray; and no way so sure or fair to the father's
      heart as by proper attention to the daughter&mdash;I know that by myself.
      Hush, now, till I have that partridge!&mdash;Whirr!&mdash;Shot him clean,
      my dear gun!&mdash;Was not that good, Harry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they continued their sport till late; and returning, loaded with
      game, had nearly reached the palace, when Corny, who had marked a covey,
      quitted Harry, and sent his dog to spring it, at a distance much greater
      than the usual reach of a common fowling-piece. Harry heard a shot, and a
      moment afterwards a violent shout of despair;&mdash;he knew the voice to
      be that of Moriarty, and running to the spot from whence it came, he found
      his friend, his benefactor, weltering in his blood. The fowling-piece,
      overloaded, had burst, and a large splinter of the barrel had fractured
      the skull, and had sunk into the brain. As Moriarty was trying to raise
      his head, O'Shane uttered some words, of which all that was intelligible
      was the name of Harry Ormond. His eye was fixed on Harry, but the meaning
      of the eye was gone. He squeezed Harry's hand, and an instant afterwards
      O'Shane's hand was powerless. The dearest, the only real friend Harry
      Ormond had upon earth was gone for ever!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A boy passing by saw what had happened, and ran to the house, calling as
      he went to some workmen, who hastened to the place, where they heard the
      howling of the dogs. Ormond neither heard nor saw&mdash;till Moriarty
      said, "He must be carried home;" and some one approaching to lift the
      body, Ormond started up, pushed the man back, without uttering a syllable&mdash;made
      a sign to Moriarty, and between them they carried the body home. Sheelah
      and the women came out to meet them, wringing their hands, and uttering
      loud lamentations. Ormond, bearing his burden as if insensible of what he
      bore, walked onward, looking at no one, answering none, but forcing his
      way straight into the house, and on&mdash;till they came to O'Shane's
      bedchamber, which was upon the ground-floor&mdash;there laid him on his
      bed. The women had followed, and all those who had gathered on the way
      rushed in to see and to bewail. Ormond looked up, and saw the people about
      the bed, and made a sign to Moriarty to keep them away, which he did, as
      well as he could. But they would not be kept back&mdash;Sheelah,
      especially, pressed forward, crying loudly, till Moriarty, with whom she
      was struggling, pointed to Harry. Struck with his fixed look, she
      submitted at once. <i>"Best leave him!"</i> said she. She put every body
      out of the room before her, and turning to Ormond, said, they would leave
      him "a little space of time till the priest should come, who was at a
      clergy dinner, but was sent for."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ormond was left alone he locked the door, and kneeling beside the
      dead, offered up prayers for the friend he had lost, and there remained
      some time in stillness and silence, till Sheelah knocked at the door, to
      let him know that the priest was come. Then retiring, he went to the other
      end of the house, to be out of the way. The room to which he went was that
      in which they had been reading the letters just before they went out that
      morning. There was the pen which Harry had taken from his hand, and the
      answer just begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear General, I hope my young friend, Harry Ormond&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      That hand could write no more!&mdash;that warm heart was cold! The
      certainty was so astonishing, so stupifying, that Ormond, having never yet
      shed a tear, stood with his eyes fixed on the paper, he knew not how long,
      till he felt some one touch his hand. It was the child, little Tommy, of
      whom O'Shane was so fond, and who was so fond of him. The child, with his
      whistle in his hand, stood looking up at Harry, without speaking. Ormond
      gazed on him for a few instants, then snatched him in his arms, and burst
      into an agony of tears. Sheelah, who had let the child in, now came and
      carried him away. "God be thanked for them tears," said she, "they will
      bring relief;" and so they did. The necessity for manly exertion&mdash;the
      sense of duty&mdash;pressed upon Ormond's recovered reason. He began
      directly, and wrote all the letters that were necessary to his guardian
      and to Miss O'Faley, to communicate the dreadful intelligence to Dora. The
      letters were not finished till late in the evening. Sheelah came for them,
      and leaving the door and the outer door to the hall open, as she came in,
      Ormond saw the candles lighted, and smelt the smell of tobacco and
      whiskey, and heard the sound of many voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wake, dear, which is beginning," said she, hastening back to shut the
      doors, as she saw him shudder. "Bear with it, Master Harry," said she:
      "hard for you!&mdash;but bear with us, dear; 'tis the custom of the
      country; and what else can we do but what the forefathers did?&mdash;how
      else for us to show respect, only as it would be expected, and has always
      been?&mdash;and great comfort to think we done our best for <i>him that is
      gone</i>, and comfort to know his wake will be talked of long hereafter,
      over the fires at night, of all the people that is there without&mdash;and
      that's all we have for it now: so bear with it, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      This night, and for two succeeding nights, the doors of Corny Castle
      remained open for all who chose to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowds, as many, and more, than the castle could hold, flocked to King
      Corny's wake, for he was greatly beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, as Sheelah said, "plenty of cake, and wine, and tea, and
      tobacco, and snuff&mdash;every thing handsome as possible, and honourable
      to the deceased, who was always open-handed and open-hearted, and with
      open house too."
    </p>
    <p>
      His praises, from time to time, were heard, and then the common business
      of the country was talked of&mdash;and jesting and laughter went on&mdash;and
      all night there were tea-drinkings for the women, and punch for the men.
      Sheelah, who inwardly grieved most, went about incessantly among the
      crowd, serving all, seeing that none, especially them who came from a
      distance, should be neglected&mdash;and that none should have to complain
      afterwards, "or to say that any thing at all was wanting or niggardly."
      Mrs. Betty, Sheelah's daughter, sat presiding at the tea-table, giving the
      keys to her mother when wanted, but never forgetting to ask for them
      again. Little Tommy took his cake and hid himself under the table, close
      by his mother, Mrs. Betty; and could not be tempted out but by Sheelah,
      whom he followed, watching for her to go in to Mr. Harry: when the door
      opened, he held by her gown, and squeezed in under her arm&mdash;and when
      she brought Mr. Harry his meals, she would set the child up at the table
      with him <i>for company</i>&mdash;and to tempt him to take something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had once promised his deceased friend, that if he was in the
      country when he died, he would put him into his coffin. He kept his
      promise. The child hearing a noise, and knowing that Mr. Harry had gone
      into the room, could not be kept out; the crowd had left that room, and
      the child looked at the bed with the curtains looped up with black&mdash;and
      at the table at the foot of the bed, with the white cloth spread over it,
      and the seven candlesticks placed upon it. But the coffin fixed his
      attention, and he threw himself upon it, clinging to it, and crying
      bitterly upon King Corny, his dear King Corny, to come back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all Sheelah could do to drag him away: Ormond, who had always liked
      this boy, felt now more fond of him than ever, and resolved that he should
      never want a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are in the mind to attend the funeral, sir, I think you told me?"
      said Sheelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," replied Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, then," said Sheelah, "if I mention&mdash;for you can't know
      what to do without. There will be high mass, may be you know, in the
      chapel. And as it's a great funeral, thirteen priests will be there,
      attending. And when the mass will be finished, it will be expected of you,
      as first of kin considered, to walk up first with your offering&mdash;whatsoever
      you think fit, for the priests&mdash;and to lay it down on the altar; and
      then each and all will follow, laying down their offerings, according as
      they can. I hope I'm not too bold or troublesome, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond thanked her for her kindness&mdash;and felt it was real kindness.
      He, consequently, did all that was expected from him <i>handsomely</i>.
      After the masses were over, the priests, who could not eat any thing
      before they said mass, had breakfast and dinner joined. Sheelah took care
      "the clergy was well served." Then the priests&mdash;though it was not
      essential that all should go, did all, to Sheelah's satisfaction,
      accompany the funeral the <i>whole way</i>, three long miles, to the
      burying-place of the O'Shanes; a remote old abbey-ground, marked only by
      some scattered trees, and a few sloping grave-stones. King Corny's funeral
      was followed by an immense concourse of people, on' horseback and on foot;
      men, women, and children: when they passed by the doors of cabins, a set
      of the women raised the funeral cry&mdash;not a savage howl, as is the
      custom in some parts of Ireland, but chanting a melancholy kind of lament,
      not without harmony, simple and pathetic. Ormond was convinced, that in
      spite of all the festivity at the wake, which had so disgusted him, the
      poor people mourned sincerely for the friend they had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      We forgot to mention that Dr. Cambray went to the Black Islands the day
      after O'Shane's death, and did all he could to prevail upon Ormond to go
      to his house while the wake was going on, and till the funeral should be
      over. But Ormond thought it right to stay where he was, as none of the
      family were there, and there was no way in which he could so strongly
      mark, as Sheelah said, his respect for the dead. Now that it was all over,
      he had at least the consolation of thinking that he had not shrunk from
      any thing that was, or that he conceived to be, his duty. Dr. Cambray was
      pleased with his conduct, and at every moment he could spare went to see
      him, doing all he could to console him, by strengthening in Ormond's mind
      the feelings of religious submission to the will of Heaven, and of pious
      hope and confidence. Ormond had no time left him for the indulgence of
      sorrow&mdash;business pressed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelius O'Shane's will, which Sir Ulick blamed Harry for not mentioning
      in the first letter, was found to be at his banker's in Dublin. All his
      property was left to his daughter, except the farm, which he had given to
      Ormond; this was specially excepted, with legal care: also a legacy of
      five hundred pounds was left to Harry; a trifling bequest to Sir Ulick,
      being his cousin; and legacies to servants. Miss O'Faley was appointed
      sole executrix&mdash;this gave great umbrage to Sir Ulick O'Shane, and
      appeared extraordinary to many people; but the will was in due form, and
      nothing could be done against it, however much might be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss O'Faley, without taking notice of any thing Ormond said of the money,
      which had been lodged in the bank to pay for his commission, wrote as
      executrix to beg of him to do various business for her&mdash;all which he
      did; and fresh letters came with new requests, inventories to be taken,
      things to be sent to Dublin, money to be received and paid, stewards' and
      agents' accounts to be settled, business of all kinds, in short, came
      pouring in&mdash;upon him, a young man unused to it, and with a mind
      peculiarly averse from it at this moment. But when he found that he could
      be of service to any one belonging to his benefactor, he felt bound in
      gratitude to exert himself to the utmost. These circumstances, however
      disagreeable, had an excellent effect upon his character, giving him
      habits of business which were ever afterwards of use to him. It was
      remarkable that the only point in his letters which had concerned his own
      affairs still continued unanswered. Another circumstance hurt his feelings&mdash;instead
      of Miss O'Faley's writing to make her own requests, Mr. Connal was soon
      deputed by Mademoiselle to write for her. He spoke of the shock the ladies
      had felt, and the distressing circumstances in which they were; all in
      commonplace phrases, which Ormond despised, and from which he could judge
      nothing of Dora's real feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The marriage must, of course," Mr. Connal said, "be put off for some
      time; and as it would be painful to the ladies to return to Corny Castle,
      he had advised their staying in Dublin; and they and he feeling assured
      that, from Mr. Ormond's regard for the family, they might take the liberty
      of troubling him, they requested so and so, and the <i>executrix</i>
      begged he would see this settled and that settled at last, with gradually
      forgotten apologies, falling very much into the style of a person writing
      to an humble friend or dependent, bound to consider requests as commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young hero's pride was piqued on the one side, as much as his
      gratitude was alive on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick O'Shane wrote to Harry that he was at this time <i>peculiarly</i>
      engaged with affairs of his own. He said, that as to the material point of
      the money lodged for the commission, he would see the executrix, and do
      what he could to have that settled; but as to all lesser points, Sir Ulick
      said, he really had not leisure to answer letters at present. He enclosed
      a note to Dr. Cambray, whom he recommended it to his ward to consult, and
      whose advice and assistance he now requested for him in pressing terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of this direct application from the young gentleman's
      guardian, Dr. Cambray felt himself authorized and called upon to
      interfere, where, otherwise, delicacy might have prevented him. It was
      fortunate for Ormond that he had Dr. Cambray's counsel to guide him, or
      else he would, in the first moments of feeling, have yielded too much to
      the suggestions of both gratitude and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first impulse of generous pride, Ormond wanted to give up the farm
      which his benefactor had left him, because he wished that no possible
      suspicion of interested motives having influenced his attachment to
      Cornelius O'Shane should exist, especially with Mr. Connal, who, as the
      husband of Dora, would soon be the lord of all in the Black Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, when Mr. Connal wrote to him, that the executrix,
      having no written order from the deceased to that effect, could not pay
      the five hundred pounds, lodged in the bank, for his commission, Ormond
      was on the point of flying out with intemperate indignation. "Was not his
      own word sufficient? Was not the intention of his benefactor apparent from
      the letters? Would not this justify any executor, any person of common
      sense or honour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cambray, his experienced and placid counsellor, brought all these
      sentiments to due measure by mildly showing what was law and justice, and
      what was fit and proper in each case; putting jealous honour, and romantic
      generosity, as they must be put, out of the question in business.
    </p>
    <p>
      He prevented Ormond from embroiling himself with Connal about the legacy,
      and from giving up his farm. He persuaded him to decline having any thing
      to do with the affairs of the Black Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proper agent was appointed, who saw Ormond's accounts settled and
      signed, so that no blame or suspicion could rest upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There seems no probability, Mr. Ormond," said Dr. Cambray, "of your
      commission being immediately purchased. Your guardian, Sir Ulick O'Shane,
      will be detained some time longer, I understand, in Dublin. You are in a
      desolate situation here&mdash;you have now done all that you ought to do&mdash;leave
      these Black Islands, and come to Vicar's Dale: you will find there a
      cheerful family, and means of spending your time more agreeably, perhaps
      more profitably, than you can have here. I am sensible that no new friends
      <i>can</i> supply to you the place of him you have lost; but you will find
      pleasure in the perception, that you have, by your own merit, attached to
      you one friend in me, who will do all in his power to soothe and serve
      you.&mdash;Will you <i>trust</i> yourself to me?" added he, smiling, "You
      have already found that I do not flatter. Will you come to us?&mdash;The
      sooner the better&mdash;to-morrow, if you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      It scarcely need be said, that this invitation was most cordially
      accepted. Next day Ormond was to leave the Black Islands. Sheelah was in
      despair when she found he was going: the child hung upon him so that he
      could hardly get out of the house, till Moriarty promised to return for
      the boy, and carry him over in the boat often, to see Mr. Ormond. Moriarty
      would not stay in the islands himself, he said, after Harry went: he let
      the cabin and little tenement which O'Shane had given him, and the rent
      was to be paid him by the agent. Ormond went, for the last time, that
      morning, to Ormond's Vale, to settle his own affairs there: he and
      Moriarty took an unusual path across this part of the island to the
      waterside, that they might avoid that which they had followed the last
      time they were out, on the day of Corny's death. They went, therefore,
      across a lone tract of heath-bog, where, for a considerable time, they saw
      no living being.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this bog, of which Cornelius O'Shane had given Moriarty a share, the
      grateful poor fellow had, the year before, amused himself with cutting in
      large letters of about a yard long the words
    </p>
    <h3>
      "LONG LIVE KING CORNY."
    </h3>
    <p>
      He had sowed the letters with broom-seed in the spring, and had since
      forgotten ever to look at them; but they were now green, and struck the
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think then of this being all the trace that's left of him on the face of
      the earth!" said Moriarty. "I'm glad that I did even that same."
    </p>
    <p>
      After crossing this lone bog, when they came to the waterside, they found
      a great crowd of people, seemingly all the inhabitants of the islands,
      assembled there, waiting to take leave of Master Harry; and each of them
      was cheered by a kind word and a look, before they would let him step into
      the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, go <i>to the continent</i>," said Sheelah, "ay, go to fifty
      continents, and in all Ireland you'll not find hearts warmer to you than
      those of the Black Islands, that knows you best from a child, Master Harry
      dear."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ormond was received with much kindness in Dr. Cambray's family, in which
      he felt himself at ease, and soon forgot that he was a stranger: his mind,
      however, was anxious about his situation, as he longed to get into active
      life. Every morning, when the post came in, he hoped there would be a
      letter for him with his commission; and he was every morning regularly
      surprised and disappointed, on finding that there was none. In the course
      of each ensuing day, however, he forgot his disappointment, and said he
      believed he was happier where he was than he could be any where else. The
      regular morning question of "Any letters for me?" was at last answered by
      "Yes; one franked by Sir Ulick O'Shane." "Ah! no commission&mdash;I feel
      no enclosure&mdash;single letter&mdash;no! double." Double or single, it
      was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR HARRY,
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I have seen the executrix and son-in-law, whom that great genius
      deceased, my well-beloved cousin in folly, King Corny, chose for himself.
      As to that thing, half mud, half tinsel, half Irish, half French, Miss, or
      Mademoiselle, O'Faley, that jointed doll, is&mdash;all but the eyes, which
      move of themselves in a very extraordinary way&mdash;a mere puppet, pulled
      by wires in the hands of another. The master showman, fully as
      extraordinary in his own way as his puppet, kept, while I was by, as much
      as possible behind the scenes. The hand and ruffle of the French
      petit-maitre, and the prompter's voice, however, were visible and audible
      enough for me. In plain English, I suppose it is no news to you to hear
      that Mdlle. O'Faley is a fool, and Monsieur de Connal, Captain O'Connal,
      Black Connal, or by whatever other <i>alias</i> he is to be called, is <i>properly</i>
      a puppy. I am sorry, my dear boy, to tell you that the fool has let the
      rogue get hold of the five hundred pounds lodged in the bank&mdash;so no
      hopes of your commission for three months, or at the least two months to
      come. My dear boy, your much-lamented friend and benefactor (is not that
      the style?), King Corny, who began, I think, by being, years ago, to your
      admiration, his own tailor, has ended, I fear to your loss, by being his
      own lawyer: he has drawn his will so that any attorney could drive a coach
      and six through it&mdash;so ends 'every man his own lawyer.' Forgive me
      this laugh, Harry. By-the-bye, you, my dear ward, will be of age in
      December, I think&mdash;then all my legal power of interference ceases.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meantime, as I know you will be out of spirits when you read this, I have
      some comfort for you and myself, which I kept for a bonne-bouche&mdash;you
      will never more see Lady O'Shane, nor I either. Articles of separation&mdash;and
      I didn't trust myself to be my own lawyer&mdash;have been signed between
      us: so I shall see her ladyship sail for England this night&mdash;won't
      let any one have the pleasure of putting her on board but myself&mdash;I
      will see her safe off, and feel well assured nothing can tempt her to
      return&mdash;even to haunt me&mdash;or scold you. This was the business
      which detained me in Dublin&mdash;well worth while to give up a summer to
      secure, for the rest of one's days, liberty to lead a bachelor's merry
      life, which I mean to do at Castle Hermitage or elsewhere, now and from
      henceforth&mdash;Miss Black in no ways notwithstanding. Miss Black, it is
      but justice to tell you, is now convinced of my conjugal virtues, and
      admires my patience as much as she used to admire Lady O'Shane's. She has
      been very useful to me in arranging my affairs in this separation&mdash;<i>in
      consequence</i>, I have procured a commission of the peace for a certain
      Mr. M'Crule, a man whom you may remember to have seen or heard at the
      bottom or corner of the table at Castle Hermitage, one of the <i>Cromwellians</i>,
      a fellow with the true draw-down of the mouth, and who speaks, or snorts,
      through his nose. I have caused him, not without some difficulty, to ask
      Miss Black to be his helpmate (Lord <i>help</i> him and forgive me!); and
      Miss Black, preferring rather to stay in Ireland and become Mrs. M'Crule
      than to return to England and continue companion to Lady O'Shane, hath
      consented (who can blame her?) to marry on the spur of the occasion&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;I
      giving her away&mdash;you may imagine with what satisfaction. What with
      marriages and separations, the business of the nation, my bank, my canal,
      and my coal-mines, you may guess my hands have been full of business. Now,
      all for pleasure! next week I hope to be down enjoying my liberty at
      Castle Hermitage, where I shall be heartily glad to have my dear Harry
      again. Marcus in England still&mdash;the poor Annalys in great distress
      about the son, with whom, I fear, it is all over. No time for more.
      Measure my affection by the length of this, the longest epistle extant in
      my hand-writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy, yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ulick O'Shane."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mixed and crossing emotions which this letter was calculated to excite
      having crossed, and mixed, and subsided a little, the predominating
      feeling was expressed by our young hero with a sigh, and this reflection:
      "Two months at the least! I must wait before I can have my commission&mdash;two
      months more in idleness the fates have decreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That last is a part of the decree that depends on yourself, not on the
      fates. Two months you must wait, but why in idleness?" said Dr. Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind and prudent doctor did not press the question&mdash;he was
      content with its being heard, knowing that it would sink into the mind and
      produce its effect in due season. Accordingly, after some time, after
      Ormond had exhaled impatience, and exhausted invective, and submitted to
      necessity, he returned to reason with the doctor. One evening, when the
      doctor and his family had returned from walking, and as the tea-urn was
      just coming in bubbling and steaming, Ormond set to work at a corner of
      the table, at the doctor's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear doctor, suppose I was now to read over to you my list of books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you were, and suppose I was to fall asleep," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least likely, sir, when you are to do any thing kind for a friend&mdash;may
      I say friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may. Come, read on&mdash;I am not proof against flattery, even at my
      age&mdash;well, read away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond began; but at that moment there drove past the windows a travelling
      chariot and four.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Ulick O'Shane, as I live!" cried Ormond, starting up. "I saw him&mdash;he
      nodded to me. Oh! no, impossible&mdash;he said he would not come till next
      week&mdash;Where's his letter?&mdash;What's the date?&mdash;Could it mean
      this week?&mdash;No, he says next week quite plainly&mdash;What can be the
      reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A note for Mr. Ormond was brought in, which had been left by one of Sir
      Ulick O'Shane's servants as they went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My commission, after all," cried Harry. "I always knew, I always said,
      that Sir Ulick was a good friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he purchased the commission?" said Dr. Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not actually say so, but that must be what his note means," said
      Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Means! but what does it say?&mdash;May I see it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is written in such a hurry, and in pencil, you'll not be able to make
      it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, however, read aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Mr. Harry Ormond will inquire at Castle Hermitage, he will hear of
      something to his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "U. O'SHANE."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go off this minute," said Mrs. Cambray, "and inquire at Castle Hermitage
      what Mr. Harry Ormond may hear to his advantage, and let us learn it as
      soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, ma'am," said Harry; and ere the words were well uttered, a
      hundred steps were lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      With more than his usual cordiality, Sir Ulick O'Shane received him, came
      out into the hall to meet his dear Harry, his own dear boy, to welcome him
      again to Castle Hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We did not expect you, sir, till next week&mdash;this is a most agreeable
      surprise. Did you not say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter what I said&mdash;you see what I have done," interrupted Sir
      Ulick; "and now I must introduce you to a niece of mine, whom you have
      never yet seen&mdash;Lady Norton, a charming, well-bred, pleasant little
      widow, whose husband died, luckily for her and me, just when they had run
      out all their large fortune. She is delighted to come to me, and is just
      the thing to do the honours of Castle Hermitage&mdash;used to the style;
      but observe, though she is to rule my roast and my boiled, she is not to
      rule me or my friends&mdash;that is a preliminary, and a special clause
      for Harry Ormond's being a privileged <i>ami de la maison</i>. Now, my
      dear fellow, you understand how the land lies; and depend upon it, you'll
      like her, and find her every way of <i>great advantage to you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, thought Harry, is this all the advantage I am to hear of?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick led on to the drawing-room, and presented him to a
      fashionable-looking lady, neither young nor old, nothing in any respect
      remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Norton, Harry Ormond&mdash;Harry Ormond, my niece, Lady Norton, who
      will make this house as pleasant to you, and to me, and to all my friends,
      as it has been unpleasant ever since&mdash;in short, ever since you were
      out of it, Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Norton, with gracious smile and well-bred courtesy, received Harry in
      a manner that promised the performance of all for which Sir Ulick had
      engaged. Tea came; and the conversation went on chiefly between Sir Ulick
      and Lady Norton on their own affairs, about invitations and engagements
      they had made, before they left Dublin, with various persons who were
      coming down to Castle Hermitage. Sir Ulick asked, "When are the Brudenells
      to come to us, my dear?&mdash;Did you settle with the Lascelles?&mdash;and
      Lady Louisa, she must be here with the vice-regal party&mdash;arrange
      that, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Norton had settled every thing; she took out an elegant
      memorandum-book, and read the arrangements to Sir Ulick. Between whiles,
      Sir Ulick turned to Ormond and noted the claims of those persons to
      distinction, and as several ladies were named, exclaimed, "Charming woman!&mdash;delightful
      little creature!&mdash;The Darrells; Harry, you'll like the Darrells too!&mdash;The
      Lardners, all clever, pleasant, and odd, will entertain you amazingly,
      Harry!&mdash;But Lady Millicent is <i>the</i> woman&mdash;nothing at all
      has been seen in this country like her!&mdash;most fascinating! Harry,
      take care of your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as to the men&mdash;this man was clever&mdash;and the other was
      quite a hero&mdash;and the next the pleasantest fellow&mdash;and the best
      sportsman&mdash;and there were men of political eminence&mdash;men who had
      distinguished themselves on different occasions by celebrated speeches&mdash;and
      particularly promising rising young; men, with whom he must make Ormond
      intimately acquainted. Now Sir Ulick closed Lady Norton's book, and taking
      it from her hand, said, "I am tiring you, my dear&mdash;that's enough for
      to-night&mdash;we'll settle all the rest to-morrow: you must be tired
      after your journey&mdash;I whirled you down without mercy&mdash;you look
      fatigued and sleepy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Norton said, "Indeed, she believed she was a little tired, and rather
      sleepy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle begged she would not sit up longer from compliment; accordingly,
      apologizing to Mr. Ormond, and "really much fatigued," she retired. Sir
      Ulick walked up and down the room, meditating for some moments, while
      Harry renewed his intimacy with an old dog, who, at every pause in the
      conversation, jumping up on him, and squealing with delight, had claimed
      his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my boy," exclaimed Sir Ulick, stopping short, "aren't you a most
      extraordinary fellow? Pray did you get my note?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir, and came instantly in consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you have never inquired what it is that you might hear to your
      advantage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I thought I had heard it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heard it, sir!" repeated Sir Ulick: "what <i>can</i> you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply, sir, that I thought the advantage you alluded to was the
      introduction you did me just now the favour to give me to Lady Norton; you
      said, her being here would be <i>a great advantage to me</i>, and that led
      me to conclude&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well! you were always a simple good fellow&mdash;confiding in my
      friendship&mdash;continue the same&mdash;you will, I am confident. But had
      you no other thought?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had," said Harry, "when first I read your note, I had, I own, another
      thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what might it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought of my commission, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of your commission?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you had procured it for me, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you ask me, I tell you honestly, that if it had been for your
      interest, I would have purchased that commission long ago; but there is a
      little secret, a political secret, which I could not tell you before&mdash;those
      who are behind the scenes cannot always speak&mdash;I may tell it to you
      now confidentially, but you must not repeat it, especially from me&mdash;that
      peace is likely to continue; so the army is out of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, if that be the case&mdash;you know best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do&mdash;it is, trust me; and as things have turned out&mdash;though I
      could not possibly foresee what has happened&mdash;every thing is for the
      best: I have come express from town to tell you news that will surprise
      you beyond measure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you mean, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply, sir, that you are possessed, or soon will be possessed of&mdash;But
      come, sit down quietly, and in good earnest let me explain to you. You
      know your father's second wife, the Indian woman, the governor's
      mahogany-coloured daughter&mdash;she had a prodigious fortune, which my
      poor friend, your father, chose, when dying, to settle upon her, and her
      Indian son; leaving you nothing but what he could not take from you, the
      little paternal estate of three hundred pounds a year. Well, it has
      pleased Heaven to take your mahogany-coloured step-mother and your Indian
      brother out of this world; both carried off within a few days of each
      other by a fever of the country&mdash;much regretted, I dare say, in the
      Bombay Gazette, by all who knew them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as neither you nor I had that honour, we are not, upon this occasion,
      called upon for any hypocrisy, farther than a black coat, which I have
      ordered for you at my tailor's. <i>Have also noted</i> and answered, <i>in
      conformity</i>, the agent's letter of 26th July, received yesterday,
      containing the melancholy intelligence: farther, replied to that part of
      his last, which requested to know how and where to transmit the property,
      which, on the Indian mother and brother's demise, falls, by the will of
      the late Captain Ormond, to his European son, Harry Ormond, esq., now
      under the guardianship of Sir Ulick O'Shane, Castle Hermitage, Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Sir Ulick produced the agent's letter, and put it into his
      ward's hand, pointing to the "useful passages." Harry, glancing his eye
      over them, understood just enough to be convinced that Sir Ulick was in
      earnest, and that he was really heir to a very considerable property.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! Harry Ormond, esq.," pursued Sir Ulick, "was I wrong when I told
      you that if you would inquire at Castle Hermitage you would hear of
      something to your advantage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>hope</i> in Heaven," said Ormond, "and <i>pray</i> to Heaven that it
      may be to my advantage!&mdash;I hope neither my head nor my heart may be
      turned by sudden prosperity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your heart&mdash;oh! I'll answer for your heart, my noble fellow," said
      Sir Ulick; "but I own you surprise me by the coolness of head you show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'll excuse me," said Ormond, "I must run this minute to tell Dr.
      Cambray and all my friends at Vicar's Dale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;quite right," said Sir Ulick&mdash;"I won't detain you a
      moment," said he&mdash;but he still held him fast. "I let you go to-night,
      but you must come to me to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will bid adieu to Vicar's Dale, and take up your quarters at
      Castle Hermitage, with your old guardian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir&mdash;delightful! But I need not bid adieu to Vicar's Dale&mdash;<i>they</i>
      are so near, I shall see them every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Sir Ulick, biting his lip; "<i>but</i> I was thinking of
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," continued Sir Ulick, "do you like a gig, a curricle, or a phaeton
      best, or what carriage will you have? there is Tom Darrel's in London now,
      who can bring it over for you. Well, we can settle that to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you please&mdash;thank you, kind Sir Ulick&mdash;how <i>can</i> you
      think so quickly of every thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horses, too&mdash;let me see," said Sir Ulick, drawing Harry back to the
      fire-place&mdash;"Ay, George Beirne is a judge of horses&mdash;he can
      choose for you, unless you like to choose for yourself. What colour&mdash;black
      or bay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare, sir, I don't know yet&mdash;my poor head is in such a state&mdash;and
      the horses happen not to be uppermost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I protest, Harry, you perfectly astonish me, by the sedateness of your
      mind and manner. You are certainly wonderfully formed and improved since I
      saw you last&mdash;but, how! in the name of wonder, in the Black Islands,
      <i>how</i> I cannot conceive," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to sedateness, you know, sir, since I saw you last, I may well be
      sobered a little, for I have suffered&mdash;not a little," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suffered! how?" said Sir Ulick, leaning his arm on the mantel-piece
      opposite to him, and listening with an air of sympathy&mdash;"suffered! I
      was not aware&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, sir, I have lost an excellent friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Corny&mdash;ay, my poor cousin, as far as he could, I am sure, he
      wished to be a friend to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wished to be, and <i>was,</i>" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have been better for him and his daughter too," resumed Sir
      Ulick, "if he had chosen you for his son-in-law, instead of the coxcomb to
      whom Dora is going to be married: yet I own, as your guardian, I am well
      pleased that Dora, though a very pretty girl, is out of your way&mdash;you
      must look higher&mdash;she was no match for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am perfectly sensible, sir, that we should never have been happy
      together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a very sensible young man, Ormond&mdash;you make me admire you,
      seriously&mdash;I always foresaw what you would be Ah! if Marcus&mdash;but
      we'll not talk of that now. Terribly dissipated&mdash;has spent an
      immensity of money already&mdash;but still, when he speaks in parliament
      he will make a figure. But good bye, good night; I see you are in a hurry
      to get away from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>From you!</i> Oh! no, sir, you cannot think me so ungrateful. I have
      not expressed, because I have not words&mdash;when I feel much, I never
      can say any thing; yet believe me, sir, I do feel your kindness, and all
      the warm fatherly interest you have this night shown that you have for me:&mdash;but
      I am in a hurry to tell my good friends the Cambrays, who I know are
      impatient for my return, and I fear I am keeping them up beyond their
      usual hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all&mdash;besides&mdash;good Heavens! can't they sit up a quarter
      of an hour, if they are so much interested?&mdash;Stay, you really hurry
      my slow wits&mdash;one thing more I had to say&mdash;pray, may I ask to <i>which</i>
      of the Miss Cambrays is it that you are so impatient to impart your good
      fortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To both, sir," said Ormond&mdash;"equally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both!&mdash;you unconscionable dog, polygamy is not permitted in these
      countries&mdash;Both! no, try again for a better answer; though that was
      no bad one at the first blush."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no other answer to give than the plain truth, sir: I am thinking
      neither of polygamy nor even of marriage at present. These young ladies
      are both very amiable, very handsome, and very agreeable; but, in short,
      we are not thinking of one another&mdash;indeed, I believe they are
      engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Engaged!&mdash;Oh! then you have thought about these young ladies enough
      to find that out. Well, this saves your gallantry&mdash;good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick had this evening taken a vast deal of superfluous pains to sound
      a mind, which lay open before him, clear to the very bottom; but because
      it was so clear, he could not believe that he saw the bottom. He did not
      much like Dr. Cambray&mdash;Father Jos was right there. Dr. Cambray was
      one of those simple characters which puzzled Sir Ulick&mdash;the idea of
      these Miss Cambrays, of the possibility of his ward's having formed an
      attachment that might interfere with his views, disturbed Sir Ulick's rest
      this night. His first operation in the morning was to walk down
      unexpectedly early to Vicar's Dale. He found Ormond with Dr. Cambray, very
      busy, examining a plan which the doctor had sketched for a new cottage for
      Moriarty&mdash;a mason was standing by, talking of sand, lime, and stones.
      "But the young ladies, where are they?" Sir Ulick asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond did not know. Mrs. Cambray, who was quietly reading, said she
      supposed they were in their gardens; and not in the least suspecting Sir
      Ulick's suspicions, she was glad to see him, and gave credit to his
      neighbourly good-will for the earliness of this visit, without waiting
      even for the doctor to pay his respects first, as he intended to do at
      Castle Hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! as to that," Sir Ulick said, "he did not intend to live on terms of
      ceremony with Dr. Cambray&mdash;he was impatient to take the first
      opportunity of thanking the doctor for his attentions to his ward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick's quick eye saw on the table in Harry's handwriting the <i>list
      of books to be read</i>. He took it up, looked it over, and with a smile
      asked, "Any thoughts of the church, Harry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; it would be rather late for me to think of the church. I should
      never prepare myself properly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," said Sir Ulick, "I have no living in my gift; but if,"
      continued he, in a tone of irony, "if, as I should opine from the list I
      hold in my hand&mdash;you look to a college living, my boy&mdash;if you
      are bent upon reading for a fellowship&mdash;I don't doubt but with Dr.
      Cambray's assistance, and with some <i>grinder</i> and <i>crammer</i>, we
      might get you cleverly through all the college examinations. And doctor,
      if he did not, in going through some of the college courses, die of a
      logical indigestion, or a classical fever, or a metaphysical lethargy, he
      might shine in the dignity of Trin. Coll. Dub., and, mad Mathesis
      inspiring, might teach eternally how the line AB is equal to the line CD,&mdash;or
      why poor X Y Z are unknown quantities. Ah! my dear boy, think of the
      pleasure, the glory of lecturing classes of <i>ignoramuses</i>, and dunces
      yet unborn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry, no way disconcerted, laughed good-humouredly with his guardian, and
      replied, "At present, sir, my ambition reaches no farther than to escape
      myself from the class of dunces and ignoramuses. I am conscious that at
      present I am very deficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>In</i> what, my dear boy?&mdash;To make your complaint English, you
      must say deficient in some thing or other&mdash;'tis an <i>Iricism</i> to
      say in general that you are <i>very deficient.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one of my particular deficiencies then you see, sir&mdash;I am
      deficient in English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not deficient in temper, I am sure," said Sir Ulick: "come, come,
      you may be tolerably well contented with yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ignorant as I am!&mdash;No," said Ormond, "I will never sit down content
      in ignorance. Now that I have the fortune of a gentleman, it would be so
      much the more conspicuous, more scandalous&mdash;now that I have every way
      the means, I will, by the blessing of Heaven, and with the help of kind
      friends, make myself something more and something better than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gad! you are a fine fellow, Harry Ormond," cried Sir Ulick: "I remember
      having once, at your age, such feelings and notions myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very unlike the first thoughts and feelings many young men would have on
      coming into unexpected possession of a fortune," said Dr. Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Sir Ulick, "and we must keep his counsel, that he may not be
      dubbed a quiz&mdash;not a word of this sort, Harry, for the Darrells, the
      Lardners, or the Dartfords."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care whether they dub me a quiz or not," said Harry, hastily:
      "what are Darrells, Lardners, or Dartfords to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are something to <i>me</i>," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I beg pardon, sir&mdash;I didn't know that&mdash;that makes it quite
      another affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, Harry, as you are to meet these young men, I thought it well to try
      how you could bear to be laughed at&mdash;I have tried you in this very
      conversation, and found you, to my infinite satisfaction, <i>ridicule
      proof</i>&mdash;better than even <i>bullet proof</i>&mdash;much better. No
      danger that a young man of spirit should be bullied out of his opinion and
      principles, but great danger that he might be <i>laughed</i> out of them&mdash;and
      I rejoice, my dear ward, to see that you are safe from this peril."
    </p>
    <p>
      Benevolent pleasure shone in Dr. Cambray's countenance, when he heard Sir
      Ulick speak in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will dine with us, Dr. Cambray?" said Sir Ulick. "Harry, you will not
      forget Castle Hermitage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forget Castle Hermitage! as if I could, where I spent my happy childhood&mdash;that
      paradise, as it seemed to me the first time&mdash;when, a poor little
      orphan boy, I was brought from my smoky cabin. I remember the day as well
      as if it were this moment&mdash;when you took me by the hand, and led me
      in, and I clung to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cling to me still! cling to me ever," interrupted Sir Ulick, "and I will
      never fail you&mdash;no, never," repeated he, grasping Harry's hand, and
      looking upon him with an emotion of affection, strongly felt, and
      therefore strongly expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I will," said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I hope," added Sir Ulick, recovering the gaiety of his tone, "that at
      Castle Hermitage a paradise will open for your youth as it opened for your
      childhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cambray put in a word of hope and fear about Vicar's Dale. To which
      Ormond answered, "Never fear, Mrs. Cambray&mdash;trust me&mdash;I know my
      own interest too well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick turning again as he was leaving the room, said with an air of
      frank liberality, "We'll settle that at once&mdash;we'll divide Harry
      between us&mdash;or we'll divide his day thus: the mornings I leave you to
      your friends and studies for an hour or two Harry, in this Vale of Eden&mdash;the
      rest of the day we must have you&mdash;men and books best mixed&mdash;see
      Bacon, and see every clever man that ever wrote or spoke. So here," added
      Sir Ulick, pointing to a map of history, which lay on the table, "you will
      have <i>The Stream of Time</i>, and with us <i>Le Courant du Jour."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick departed. During the whole of this conversation, and of that of
      the preceding night, while he seemed to be talking at random of different
      things, unconnected and of opposite sorts, he had carefully attended to
      one object. Going round the whole circle of human motives&mdash;love,
      ambition, interest, ease, pleasure, he had made accurate observation on
      his ward's mind; and reversing the order, he went round another way, and
      repeated and corrected his observations. The points he had strongly noted
      for practical use were, that for retaining influence over his ward, he
      must depend not upon interested motives of any kind, nor upon the force of
      authority or precedent, nor yet on the power of ridicule, but principally
      upon feelings of honour, gratitude, and generosity. Harry now no longer
      crossed any of his projects, but was become himself the means of carrying
      many into execution. The plan of a match for Marcus with Miss Annaly was
      entirely at an end. That young lady had given a decided refusal; and some
      circumstances, which we cannot here stop to explain, rendered Marcus and
      his father easy under that disappointment. No jealousy or competition
      existing, therefore, any longer between his son and ward, Sir Ulick's
      affection for Ormond returned in full tide; nor did he reproach himself
      for having banished Harry from Castle Hermitage, or for having formerly
      neglected, and almost forgotten him for two or three years. Sir Ulick took
      the matter up just as easily as he had laid it down&mdash;he now looked on
      Harry not as the youth whom he had deserted, but as the orphan boy whom he
      had cherished in adversity, and whom he had a consequent right to produce
      and patronize in prosperity. Beyond, or beneath all this, there was
      another reason why Sir Ulick took so much pains, and felt so much anxiety,
      to establish his influence over his ward. This reason cannot yet be
      mentioned&mdash;he had hardly revealed it to himself&mdash;it was deep
      down in his soul&mdash;to be or not to be&mdash;as circumstances, time,
      and the hour, should decide.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After having lived so long in retirement, our young hero, when he was to
      go into company again, had many fears that his manners would appear rustic
      and unfashioned. With all these apprehensions as to his manners there was
      mixed a large proportion of pride of character, which tended rather to
      increase than to diminish his apparent timidity. He dreaded that people
      would value him, or think that he valued himself, for his newly acquired
      fortune, instead of his good qualities: he feared that he should be
      flattered; and he feared that he should like flattery. In the midst of all
      these various and contradictory apprehensions, he would perhaps have been
      awkward and miserable, had he been introduced into society by one who had
      less knowledge of the world, or less knowledge of the human heart, than
      Sir Ulick O'Shane possessed. Sir Ulick treated him as if he had always
      lived in good company. Without presupposing any ignorance, he at the same
      time took care to warn him of any etiquette or modern fashion, so that no
      one should perceive the warning but themselves. He neither offended
      Ormond's pride by seeming to patronize or <i>produce</i> him, nor did he
      let his timidity suffer from uncertainty or neglect. Ormond's fortune was
      never adverted to, in any way that could hurt his desire to be valued for
      his own sake; but he was made to feel that it was a part, and a very
      agreeable part, of his personal merit. Managed in this kind and skilful
      manner, he became perfectly at ease and happy. His spirits rose, and he
      enjoyed every thing with the warmth of youth, and with the enthusiasm of
      his natural character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first evening that "the earthly paradise" of Castle Hermitage
      re-opened upon his view, he was presented to all the well-dressed,
      well-bred belles. Black, brown, and fair, for the first hour appeared to
      him all beautiful. His guardian standing apart, and seeming to listen to a
      castle secretary, who was whispering to him of state affairs, observed all
      that was passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to his guardian's expectations, however, Ormond was the next
      morning faithful to his resolution, and did not appear among the angels at
      the breakfast-table at Castle Hermitage. "It won't last a good week," said
      Sir Ulick to himself. But that good week, and the next, it lasted. Harry's
      studies, to be sure, were sometimes interrupted by floating visions of the
      Miss Darrells, Dartfords, and Lardners. He every now and then sung bits of
      their songs, repeated their bon-mots, and from time to time laying down
      his book, started up and practised quadrille steps, to refresh himself,
      and increase his attention. His representations of all he saw and heard at
      Castle Hermitage, and his frank and natural description of the impression
      that every thing and every body made upon him, were amusing and
      interesting to his friends at Vicar's Dale. It was not by satire that he
      amused them, but by simplicity mixed with humour and good sense&mdash;good
      sense sometimes half opening his eyes, and humour describing what he saw
      with those eyes, half open, half shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray what sort of people are the Darrells and Dartfords?" said Mrs.
      Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! delightful&mdash;the girls especially&mdash;sing like angels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the ladies I know are all angels with you at present&mdash;that you
      have told us several times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's really true, I believe&mdash;at least as far as I can see: but you
      know I have not had time to see farther than the outside yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentlemen, however&mdash;I suppose you have seen the inside of some
      of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;those who have any thing inside of them&mdash;Dartford,
      for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Dartford, he is the man Sir Ulick said was so clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very clever&mdash;he is&mdash;I suppose, though I don't really recollect
      any thing remarkable that I have heard him say. But the wit must be <i>in</i>
      him&mdash;and he lets out a good deal of his opinions&mdash;of his opinion
      of himself a little too much. But he is much admired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. Darrell&mdash;what of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very fashionable. But indeed all I know about him is, that his dress is
      <i>quite the thing</i>, and that he knows more about dishes and cooks than
      I could have conceived any man upon earth of his age could know&mdash;but
      they say it's the fashion&mdash;he is very fashionable, I hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is he conceited?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I do not know&mdash;his manner might appear a little conceited&mdash;but
      in reality he must be wonderfully humble&mdash;for he certainly values his
      horses far above himself&mdash;and then he is quite content if his
      boot-tops are admired. By-the-bye, there is a <i>famous invaluable</i>
      receipt he has for polishing those boot-tops, which is to make quite
      another man of me&mdash;if I don't forget to put him in mind about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. Lardner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! a pleasant young man&mdash;has so many good songs, and good stories,
      and is so good-natured in repeating them. But I hope people won't make him
      repeat them too often, for I can conceive one might be tired, in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the course of the first three weeks, Harry was three times in
      imminent danger of falling in love&mdash;first, with the beautiful, and
      beautifully dressed, Miss Darrell, who danced, sung, played, rode, did
      every thing charmingly, and was universally admired. She was remarkably
      good-humoured, even when some of her companions were rather cross. Miss
      Darrell reigned queen of the day, and queen of the ball, for three days
      and three nights, unrivalled in our young hero's eyes; but on the fourth
      night, Ormond chancing to praise the fine shape of one of her very dear
      friends, Miss Darrell whispered, "She owes that fine shape to a finely
      padded corset. Oh! I am clear of what I tell you&mdash;she is my intimate
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Ormond was cured of all desire to be the intimate friend
      of this fair lady. The second peerless damsel, whose praises he sounded to
      Dr. Cambray, between the fits of reading Middleton's Cicero, was Miss
      Eliza Darrell, the youngest of the three sisters: she was not yet <i>come
      out</i>, though in the mean time allowed to appear at Castle Hermitage;
      and she was so <i>nave</i>, and so timid, and so very bashful, that Sir
      Ulick was forced always to bring her into the room leaning on his arm;&mdash;she
      could really hardly walk into a room&mdash;and if any body looked at her,
      she was so much distressed&mdash;and there were such pretty confusions and
      retreatings, and such a manoeuvring to get to the side-table every day,
      and "Sir Ulick so terribly determined it should not be." It was all
      naturally acted, and by a young pretty actress. Ormond, used only to the
      gross affectation of Dora, did not suspect that there was any affectation
      in the case. He pitied her so much, that Sir Ulick was certain "love was
      in the next degree." Of this the young lady herself was still more secure;
      and in her security she forgot some of her graceful timidity. It happened
      that, in standing up for country dances one night, some dispute about
      precedency occurred. Miss Eliza Darrell was the <i>honourable</i> Eliza
      Darrell; and some young lady, who was not honourable, in contempt,
      defiance, neglect, or ignorance, stood above her. The timid Eliza
      remonstrated in no very gentle voice, and the colour came into her face&mdash;"the
      eloquent blood spoke" too plainly. She!&mdash;the gentle Eliza!&mdash;pushed
      for her place, and with her honourable elbows made way for herself; for
      what will not even well-bred belles do in a crowd? Unfortunately,
      well-bred beaux are bound to support them. Ormond was on the point of
      being drawn into a quarrel with the partner of the offending party, when
      Sir Ulick appearing in the midst, and not seeming to know that any thing
      was going wrong, broke up the intended set of country dances, by insisting
      upon it that the Miss Darrells had promised him a quadrille, and that they
      must dance it then, as there was but just time before supper. Harry, who
      had seen how little his safety was in the eye of the gentle Eliza, in
      comparison with the most trifling point of her offended pride, was
      determined in future not to expose himself to similar danger. The next
      young lady who took his fancy was of course as unlike the last as
      possible: she was one of the remarkably pleasant, sprightly, clever, most
      agreeable Miss Lardners. She did not interest him much, but she amused him
      exceedingly. Her sister had one day said to her, "Anne, you can't be
      pretty, so you had better be odd." Anne took the advice, set up for being
      odd, and succeeded. She was a mimic, a wit, and very satirical; and as
      long as the satire touched only those for whom he did not care, Ormond was
      extremely diverted. He did not think it quite feminine or amiable, but
      still it was entertaining: there was also something flattering in being
      exempted from this general reprobation and ridicule. Miss Lardner was
      intolerant of all insipid people&mdash;<i>flats</i>, as she called them.
      How far Ormond might have been drawn on by this laughing, talking,
      satirical, flattering wit, there is no saying; but luckily they fell out
      one evening about old Lady Annaly. Miss Lardner was not aware that Ormond
      knew, much less could she have conceived, that he liked her ladyship. Miss
      Lardner was mimicking her, for the amusement of a set of young ladies who
      were standing round the fire after dinner, when Harry Ormond came in: he
      was not quite as much diverted as she expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ormond does not know the <i>original</i>&mdash;the copy is lost upon
      him," said Miss Lardner; "and happy it is for you," continued she, turning
      to him, "that you do not know her, for Lady Annaly is as stiff and
      tiresome an original as ever was seen or heard of;&mdash;and the worst of
      it is, she is an original without originality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Annaly!" cried Ormond, with surprise, "surely not the Lady Annaly I
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's but one that I know of&mdash;Heaven forbid that there were two!
      But I beg your pardon, Mr. Ormond, if she is a friend of yours&mdash;I
      humbly beg your forgiveness&mdash;I did not know your taste was so <i>very
      good!</i>&mdash;.Lady Annaly is a fine old lady, certainly&mdash;vastly
      respectable; and I so far agree with Mr. Ormond, that of the two paragons,
      mother and daughter, I prefer the mother. Paragons in their teens are
      insufferable:&mdash;patterns of perfection are good for nothing in
      society, except to be torn to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lardner pursued this diversion of tearing them to pieces, still
      flattering herself that her present wit and drollery would prevail with
      Ormond, as she had found it prevail with most people against an absent
      friend. But Ormond thought upon this occasion she showed more flippancy
      than wit, and more ill-nature than humour. He was shocked at the want of
      feeling and reverence for age with which she, a young girl, just entering
      into the world, spoke of a person of Lady Annaly's years and high
      character. In the heat of attack, and in her eagerness to carry her point
      against the Annalys, the young lady, according to custom, proceeded from
      sarcasm to scandal. Every ill-natured report she had ever heard against
      any of the family, she now repeated with exaggeration and asseverations&mdash;vehement
      in proportion to the weakness of proof. She asserted that Lady Annaly,
      with all her high character, was very hard-hearted to some of her nearest
      family connexions. Sweet Lady Millicent!&mdash;Oh! how barbarously she
      used her!&mdash;Miss Annaly too she attacked, as a cold-blooded jilt. If
      the truth must be told, she had actually broken the heart of a young
      nobleman, who was fool enough to be taken in by her sort of manner: and
      the son, the famous Sir Herbert Annaly! he was an absolute miser: Miss
      Lardner declared that she knew, from the best authority, most shameful
      instances of his shabbiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instances were stated, but Ormond could not believe these stories; and
      what was more, he began to doubt the good faith of the person by whom they
      were related. He suspected that she uttered these slanders, knowing them
      to be false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lardner observing that Ormond made no farther defence, but now stood
      silent, and with downcast eyes, flattered herself that she had completely
      triumphed. Changing the subject, she would have resumed with him her
      familiar, playful tone; but all chance of her ever triumphing over
      Ormond's head or heart was now at an end: so finished the third of his
      three weeks' <i>fancies</i>. Such evanescent fancies would not have been
      worth mentioning, but for the effect produced on his mind; though they
      left scarcely any individual traces, they made a general and useful
      impression. They produced a permanent contempt for <i>scandal</i>, that
      common vice of idle society. He determined to guard against it cautiously
      himself; and ever after, when he saw a disposition to it in any woman,
      however highly-bred, highly-accomplished, or highly-gifted, he considered
      her as a person of mean mind, with whom he could never form any connexion
      of friendship or love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lardners, Darrells, Dartfords, vanished, and new figures were to
      appear in the magic lantern at Castle Hermitage. Sir Ulick thought a few
      preliminary observations necessary to his ward. His opinion of Ormond's
      capacity and steadiness had considerably diminished, in consequence of his
      various mistakes of character, and sudden changes of opinion; for Sir
      Ulick, with all his abilities, did not discriminate between want of
      understanding, and want of practice. Besides, he did not see the whole: he
      saw the outward boyish folly&mdash;he did not see the inward manly sense;
      he judged Ormond by a false standard, by comparison with the young men of
      the world of his own age. He knew that none of these, even of moderate
      capacity, could have been three times in three weeks so near being <i>taken
      in</i>&mdash;not one would have made the sort of blunders, much less would
      any one, having made them, have acknowledged them as frankly as Ormond
      did. It was this <i>imprudent</i> candour which lowered him most in his
      guardian's estimation. From not having lived in society, Harry was not
      aware of the signs and tokens of folly or wisdom by which the world judge;
      the opinion of the bystanders had not habitual power over him. While the
      worldly young men guarded themselves with circumspect self-love against
      every external appearance of folly, Harry was completely unguarded: they
      lived cheaply upon borrowed wisdom; he profited dearly, but permanently,
      by his own experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," said Sir Ulick, "are you aware that his Excellency the Lord
      Lieutenant is coming to Castle Hermitage to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; so I heard you say," replied Harry. "What sort of a man is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Man!</i>" repeated Sir Ulick, smiling. "In the first place, he is a
      very <i>great</i> man, and may be of great service to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, sir? I don't want any thing from him. Now I have a good fortune
      of my own, what can I want from any man&mdash;or if I must not say <i>man</i>,
      any <i>great</i> man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harry, though a man's fortune is good, it may be better for
      pushing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And worse, may it not, sir? Did not I hear you speaking last night of
      Lord Somebody, who had been pushing his fortune all his life, and died
      pennyless?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, because he pushed ill; if he had pushed well, he would have got
      into a good place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank Heaven, I can get that now without any pushing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can!&mdash;yes, by my interest perhaps you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; by my own money, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bribery and corruption! Harry. Places are not in this country to be
      bought&mdash;openly&mdash;these are things one must not talk of: and pray,
      with your own money&mdash;if you could&mdash;what place upon earth would
      you purchase?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only place in the world I should wish for, sir, would be a place in
      the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick was surprised and alarmed; but said not a word that could betray
      his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A place of my own," continued Ormond, "a comfortable house and estate, on
      which I could live independently and happily, with some charming amiable
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darrell, Dartford, Lardner, which?" said Sir Ulick, with a sarcastic
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am cured of these foolish fancies, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there is another more dangerous might seize you, against which I
      must warn you, and I trust one word of advice you will not take amiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I am very much obliged to you: how could I take advice from you as
      any thing but a proof of friendship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, my dear boy, I must tell you, <i>in confidence</i>, what you will
      find out the first night you are in his company, that his Excellency
      drinks hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No danger of my following his example," said Harry. "Thank you, sir, for
      the warning; but I am sure enough of myself on this point, because I have
      been tried&mdash;and when I would not drink to please my own dear King
      Corny, there is not much danger of my drinking to please a Lord
      Lieutenant, who, after all, is nothing to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said Sir Ulick; "but you are not come to <i>after all</i> yet&mdash;you
      know nothing about his Excellency yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but what you have told me, sir: if he drinks hard, I think he
      sets no very good example as a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What oft was thought, perhaps, but ne'er so bluntly expressed," said Sir
      Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick was afterwards surprised to see the firmness with which his
      ward, when in company with persons of the first rank and fashion, resisted
      the combined force of example, importunity, and ridicule. Dr. Cambray was
      pleased, but not surprised; for he had seen in his young friend other
      instances of this adherence to whatever he had once been convinced was
      right. Resolution is a quality or power of mind totally independent of
      knowledge of the world. The habit of self-control can be acquired by any
      individual, in any situation. Ormond had practised and strengthened it,
      even in the retirement of the Black Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other and far more dangerous trials were now preparing for him; but before
      we go on to these, it may be expected that we should not pass over in
      silence the vice-regal visit&mdash;and yet what can we say about it? All
      that Ormond could say was, that "he supposed it was a great honour, but it
      was no great pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mornings, two out of five, being rainy, hung very heavily on hand in
      spite of the billiard-room. Fine weather, riding, shooting, or boating,
      killed time well enough till dinner; and Harry said he liked this part of
      the business exceedingly, till he found that some great men were very
      cross, if they did not shoot as many little birds as he did. Then came
      dinner, the great point of relief and reunion!&mdash;and there had been
      late dinners, and long dinners, and great dinners, fine plate, good
      dishes, and plenty of wine, but a dearth of conversation&mdash;the natural
      topics chained up by etiquette. One half of the people at table were too
      prudent, the other half too stupid, to talk. Sir Ulick talked away indeed;
      but even he was not half so entertaining as usual, because he was forced
      to bring down his wit and humour to <i>court quality</i>. In short, till
      the company had drunk a certain quantity of wine, nothing was said worth
      repeating, and afterwards nothing repeatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the vice-regal raree show was over, and that the grand folk had been
      properly bowed into their carriages, and had fairly driven away, there was
      some diversion to be had. People, without yawning, seemed to recover from
      a dead sleep; the state of the atmosphere was changed; there was a happy
      thaw; the frozen words and bits and ends of conversations were repeated in
      delightful confusion. The men of wit, in revenge for their prudent
      silence, were now happy and noisy beyond measure. Ormond was much
      entertained: he had an opportunity of being not only amused but instructed
      by conversation, for all the great dealers in information, who had kept up
      their goods while there was no market, now that there was a demand,
      unpacked, and brought them out in profusion. There was such a rich supply,
      and such a quick and happy intercourse of wit and knowledge, as quite
      delighted, almost dazzled, his eyes; but his eyes were strong. He had a
      mind untainted with envy, highly capable of emulation. Much was indeed
      beyond, or above, the reach of his present powers; but nothing was beyond
      his generous admiration&mdash;nothing above his future hopes of
      attainment. The effect and more than the effect, which Sir Ulick had
      foreseen, was produced on Ormond's mind by hearing the conversation of
      some of those who had distinguished themselves in political life; he
      caught their spirit&mdash;their ambition: his wish was no longer merely to
      see the world, but to distinguish himself in it. His guardian saw the
      noble ambition rising in his mind. Oh! at that instant, how could he think
      of debasing it to servile purposes&mdash;of working this great power only
      for paltry party ends?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      New circumstances arose, which unexpectedly changed the course of our
      hero's mind. There was a certain Lady Millicent, whose name Lady Norton
      had read from her memorandum-book among the list of guests expected at
      Castle Hermitage. Sir Ulick, as Ormond recollected, had pronounced her to
      be a charming, elegant, fascinating creature. Sir Ulick's praise was
      sometimes exaggerated, and often lavished from party motives, or given
      half in jest and half in earnest, against his conscience. But when he did
      speak sincerely, no man's taste or judgment as to female beauty, manners,
      and character, could be more safely trusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sincere in all he said of Lady Millicent's appearance and manners;
      but as to the rest, he did not think himself bound to tell all he knew
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship arrived at Castle Hermitage. Ormond saw her, and thought that
      his guardian had not in the least exaggerated as to her beauty, grace, or
      elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a very young widow, still in mourning for her husband, a gallant
      officer, who had fallen the preceding year at a siege in Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Millicent, as Lady Norton said, had not recovered, and she feared
      never would recover from the shock her health had received at the time of
      her husband's death. This account interested Ormond exceedingly for the
      young widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something peculiarly engaging in the pensive softness and
      modesty of her manner. It appeared free from affectation. Far from making
      any display of her feelings, she seemed as much as possible to repress
      them, and to endeavour to be cheerful, that she might not damp the gaiety
      of others. Her natural disposition, Lady Norton said, was very sprightly;
      and however passive and subdued she might appear at present, she was of a
      high independent spirit, that would, on any great occasion, think and act
      for itself. Better and better&mdash;each trait suited Ormond's character
      more and more: his own observation confirmed the high opinion which the
      praises of her friend tended to inspire. Ormond was particularly pleased
      with the indulgent manner in which Lady Millicent spoke of her own sex;
      she was free from that propensity to detraction which had so disgusted him
      in his last love. Even of those by whom, as it had been hinted to him, she
      had been hardly treated, she spoke with gentleness and candour.
      Recollecting Miss Lardner's assertion, that "Lady Annaly had used Lady
      Millicent barbarously," he purposely mentioned Lady Annaly, to hear what
      she would say. "Lady Annaly," said she, "is a most respectable woman&mdash;she
      has her prejudices&mdash;who is there that has not?&mdash;It is
      unfortunate for me that she has been prepossessed against <i>me</i>. She
      is one of my nearest connexions by marriage&mdash;one to whom I might have
      looked in difficulty and distress&mdash;one of the few persons whose
      assistance and interference I would willingly have accepted, and would
      even have stooped to ask; but unhappily&mdash;I can tell you no more,"
      said she, checking herself: "it is every way an unfortunate affair; and,"
      added she, after a deep sigh, "the most unfortunate part of it is, that it
      is my own fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>That</i> Ormond could hardly believe; and whether it were or not,
      whatever the unfortunate affair might be, the candour, the gentleness,
      with which she spoke, even when her feelings were obviously touched and
      warm, interested him deeply in her favour. He had heard that the Annalys
      were just returning to Ireland, and he determined to go as soon as
      possible to see them: he hoped they would come to Castle Hermitage, and
      that this coolness might be made up. Meantime the more he saw of Lady
      Millicent, the more he was charmed with her. Sir Ulick was much engaged
      with various business in the mornings, and Lady Norton, Lady Millicent,
      and Ormond, spent their time together: walking, driving in the sociable,
      or boating on the lake, they were continually together. Lady Norton, a
      very good kind of well-bred little woman, was a nonentity in conversation;
      but she never interrupted it, nor laid the slightest restraint on any one
      by her presence, which, indeed, was usually forgotten by Ormond. His
      conversation with Lady Millicent generally took a sentimental turn. She
      did not always speak sense, but she talked elegant nonsense with a sweet
      persuasive voice and eloquent eyes: hers was a kind of exalted sentimental
      morality, referring every thing to feeling, and to the notion of <i>sacrifice</i>,
      rather than to a sense of duty, principle, or reason. She was all for
      sensibility and enthusiasm&mdash;enthusiasm in particular&mdash;with her
      there was no virtue without it. Acting from the hope of making yourself or
      others happy, or from any view of utility, was acting merely from low
      selfish motives. Her "point of virtue was so high, that ordinary mortals
      might well console themselves by perceiving the impossibility of ever
      reaching it." Exalted to the clouds, she managed matters as she pleased
      there, and made charming confusion. When she condescended to return to
      earth, and attempted to define&mdash;no, not to define&mdash;definitions
      were death to her imagination!&mdash;but to <i>describe</i> her notions,
      she was nearly unintelligible. She declared, however, that she understood
      herself perfectly well; and Ormond, deceived by eloquence, of which he was
      a passionate admirer, thought that he understood when he only <i>felt</i>.
      Her ideas of virtue were carried to such extremes, that they touched the
      opposite vices&mdash;in truth, there was nothing to prevent them; for the
      line between right and wrong, that line which should be strongly marked,
      was effaced: so delicately had sentiment shaded off its boundaries. These
      female metaphysics, this character of exalted imagination and sensitive
      softness, was not quite so cheap and common some years ago, as it has
      lately become. The consequences to which it practically leads were not
      then fully foreseen and understood. At all times a man experienced in
      female character, who had any knowledge of the world, even supposing he
      had no skill in metaphysics, would easily have seen to what all this
      tends, and where it usually terminates; and such a man would never have
      thought of marrying Lady Millicent. But Ormond was inexperienced: the
      whole, matter and manner, was new to him; he was struck with the delicacy
      and sensibility of the fair sophist, and with all that was ingenious and
      plausible in the doctrine, instead of being alarmed by its dangerous
      tendency. It should be observed, in justice to Lady Millicent, that she
      was perfectly sincere&mdash;if we may use the expression <i>of good faith</i>
      in absurdities. She did not use this sentimental sophistry, as it has
      since been too often employed by many, to veil from themselves the
      criminality of passion, or to mark the deformity of vice: there was,
      perhaps, the more immediate hazard of her erring from ignorance and
      rashness; but there was also, in her youth and innocence, a chance that
      she might instinctively start back the moment she should see the
      precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Sir Ulick was talking of Lord Chesterfield's Letters, a book
      at that time much in vogue, but which the good sense and virtue of England
      soon cast into disrepute; and which, in spite of the charms of wit and
      style, in spite of many sparkling and some valuable observations mixed
      with its corruption, has since sunk, fortunately for the nation, almost
      into oblivion. But when these <i>private</i> letters were first published,
      and when my lord, who now appears so stiff and awkward, was in the fashion
      of the day, there was no withstanding it. The book was a manual of
      education&mdash;with the vain hope of getting cheaply second-hand
      knowledge of the world, it was read universally by every young man
      entering life, from the nobleman's son, while his hair was powdering, to
      the 'prentice thumbing it surreptitiously behind the counter. Sir Ulick
      O'Shane, of course, recommended it to his ward: to Lady Millicent's
      credit, she inveighed against it with honest indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Sir Ulick, smiling, "you are shocked at the idea of Lord
      Chesterfield's advising his pupil at Paris to prefer a reputable affair
      with a married woman, to a disreputable intrigue with an opera girl! Well,
      I believe you are right as an Englishwoman, my dear Lady Millicent; and I
      am clear, at all events, that you are right, as a woman, to blush so
      eloquently with virtuous indignation:&mdash;Lady Annaly herself could not
      have spoken and looked the thing better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I was just thinking," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the difference, Harry, between a young and an elderly woman," said
      Sir Ulick. "Truths divine come mended from the lips of youth and beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      His compliment was lost upon Lady Millicent. At the first mention of Lady
      Annaly's name she had sighed deeply, and had fallen into reverie&mdash;and
      Ormond, as he looked at her, fell into raptures at the tender expression
      of her countenance. Sir Ulick tapped him on the shoulder, and drawing him
      a little on one side, "Take care of your heart, young man," whispered he:
      "no serious attachment here&mdash;remember, I warn you." Lady Norton
      joined them, and nothing more was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care of my heart," thought Ormond: "why should I guard it against
      such a woman?&mdash;what better can I do with it than offer it to such a
      woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought had crossed Ormond's mind which recurred at this instant. From
      the great admiration Sir Ulick expressed for Lady Millicent, and the
      constant attention&mdash;more than gallant&mdash;tender attention, which
      Sir Ulick paid her, Ormond was persuaded that, but for that half of the
      broken chain of matrimony which still encumbered him whom it could not
      bind, Sir Ulick would be very glad to offer Lady Millicent not only his
      heart but his hand. Suspecting this partiality, and imagining a latent
      jealousy, Ormond did not quite like to consult his guardian about his own
      sentiments and proceedings. He wished previously to consult his impartial
      and most safe friend, Dr. Cambray. But Dr. Cambray had been absent from
      home ever since the arrival of Lady Millicent. The doctor and his family
      had been on a visit to a relation at a distance. Ormond, impatient for
      their return, had every day questioned the curate; and at last, in reply
      to his regular question of "When do you expect the doctor, sir?" he heard
      the glad tidings of "We expect him to-morrow, or next day, sir,
      positively."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Ormond, who was now master of a very elegant phaeton and
      beautiful gray horses, and, having for some time been under the tuition of
      that knowing whip Tom Darrell, could now drive to admiration, prevailed
      upon Lady Millicent to trust herself with him in his phaeton&mdash;Sir
      Ulick came up just as Ormond had handed Lady Millicent into the carriage,
      and, pressing on his ward's shoulder, said, "Have you the reins safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well&mdash;remember now, Harry Ormond," said he, with a look which
      gave a double meaning to his words, "remember, I charge you, the warning I
      gave you last niwht&mdash;drive carefully&mdash;pray, young sir, look
      before you&mdash;no rashness!&mdash;young horses these," added he, patting
      the horses&mdash;"pray be careful, Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond promised to be very careful, and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," thought he, "my guardian must have some good reason for this
      reiterated caution; I will not let her see my sentiments till I know his
      reasons; besides, as Dr. Cambray returns to-morrow, I can wait another
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, though not without putting considerable restraint upon
      himself, Ormond talked of the beauties of nature, and of indifferent
      matters. The conversation rather nagged, and sometimes on her ladyship's
      side as well as on his. He fancied that she was more reserved than usual,
      and a little embarrassed. He exerted himself to entertain her&mdash;that
      was but common civility;&mdash;he succeeded, was pleased to see her
      spirits rise, and her embarrassment wear off. When she revived, her manner
      was this day so peculiarly engaging, and the tones of her voice so soft
      and winning, that it required all Ormond's resolution to refrain from
      declaring his passion. Now, for the first time, he conceived a hope that
      he might make himself agreeable to her; that he might, in time, soothe her
      grief, and restore her to happiness. Her expressions were all delicately
      careful to imply nothing but friendship&mdash;but a woman's friendship
      insensibly leads to love. As they were returning home after a delightful
      drive, they entered upon this subject, so favourable to the nice casuistry
      of sentiment, and to the enthusiastic eloquence of passion&mdash;when, at
      an opening in the road, a carriage crossed them so suddenly, that Ormond
      had but just time to pull up his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Cambray, I declare: the very man I wished to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, whose countenance had been full of affectionate pleasure at
      the first sight of his young friend, changed when he saw who was in the
      phaeton with him. The doctor looked panic-struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Millicent, Dr. Cambray," Ormond began the introduction; but each
      bowing, said, in a constrained voice, "I have the honour of knowing&mdash;"
      "I have the pleasure of being acquainted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasure and honour seemed to be painful and embarrassing to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let us detain you," said the doctor; "but I hope, Mr. Ormond, you
      will let me see you as soon as you can at Vicar's Dale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not doubt that, my dear doctor," said Ormond, "if you knew how
      impatient I have been for your return&mdash;I will be with you before you
      are all out of the carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sooner the better," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sooner the better," echoed the friendly voices of Mrs. Cambray and
      her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond drove on; but from this moment, till they reached Castle Hermitage,
      no more agreeable conversation passed between him and his fair companion.
      It was all constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not aware that Dr. Cambray had the honour of being acquainted with
      Lady Millicent," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O yes! I had the pleasure some time ago," replied Lady Millicent, "when
      he was in Dublin&mdash;not lately&mdash;I was a great favourite of his
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once, and always, I should have thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Cambray's a most amiable, respectable man," said her ladyship: "he
      must be a great acquisition in this neighbourhood&mdash;a good clergyman
      is valuable every where; in Ireland most especially, where the spirit of
      conciliation is much wanted. 'Tis unknown how much a good clergyman may do
      in Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true&mdash;certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      So with a repetition of truisms, interspersed with reflections on the
      state of Ireland, tithes, and the education of the poor, they reached
      Castle Hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Millicent, you look pale," said Sir Ulick, as he handed her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I have had a most delightful drive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry just stayed to say that Dr. Cambray was returned, and that he must
      run to see him, and off he went. He found the doctor in his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear doctor," said Ormond, in breathless consternation, "what is
      the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, I hope," said the doctor, looking earnestly in Ormond's face;
      "and yet your countenance tells me that my fears are well founded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you fear, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lady who was in the phaeton with you, Lady Millicent, I fear&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you fear, sir?&mdash;Oh! tell me at once&mdash;what do you
      know of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once, then, I know her to be a very imprudent, though hope she is
      still an innocent woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Innocent!" repeated Ormond. "Good Heavens! is it possible that there can
      be any doubt? Imprudent! My dear doctor, perhaps you have been
      misinformed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I know on the subject is this," said Dr. Cambray: "during Lord
      Millicent's absence on service, a gentleman of high rank and gallantry
      paid assiduous attention to Lady Millicent. Her relation and friend, Lady
      Annaly, advised her to break off all intercourse with this gentleman in
      such a decided manner, as to silence scandal. Lady Millicent followed but
      half the advice of her friend; she discountenanced the public attentions
      of her admirer, but she took opportunities of meeting him at private
      parties: Lady Annaly again interfered&mdash;Lady Millicent was offended:
      but the death of her husband saved her from farther danger, and opened her
      eyes to the views of a man, who thought her no longer worthy his pursuit,
      when he might have her for life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond saw that there was no resource for him but immediately to quit
      Castle Hermitage; therefore, the moment he returned, he informed Sir Ulick
      of his determination, pointing out to him the impropriety of his remaining
      in the society of Lady Millicent, when his opinion of her character and
      the sentiments which had so strongly influenced his behaviour, were
      irrevocably changed. This was an unexpected blow upon Sir Ulick: he had
      his private reasons for wishing to detain Ormond at Castle Hermitage till
      he was of age, to dissipate his mind by amusement and variety, and to
      obtain over it an habitual guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond proposed immediately to visit the continent: by the time he should
      arrive at Paris, Dora would be settled there, and he should be introduced
      into the best company. The subtle Sir Ulick, perceiving that Ormond must
      change his quarters, advised him to see something of his own country
      before he went abroad. In the course of a few days, various letters of
      recommendation were procured for him from Sir Ulick and his connexions;
      and, what was of still more consequence, from Dr. Cambray and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this interval, Ormond once more visited the Black Islands; scenes
      which recalled a thousand tender, and a few embittering, recollections. He
      was greeted with heartfelt affection by many of the inhabitants of the
      island, with whom he had passed some of his boyish days. Of some scenes he
      had to be ashamed, but of others he was justly proud; and from every
      tongue he heard the delightful praises of his departed friend and
      benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His little farm had been well managed during his absence; the trees he had
      planted began to make some appearance; and, upon the whole, his visit to
      the Black Islands revived his generous feelings, and refreshed those
      traces of early virtue which had been engraven on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Castle Hermitage every thing had been prepared for his departure; and
      upon visiting his excellent friend at the vicarage, he found the whole
      family heartily interested in his welfare, and ready to assist him, by
      letters of introduction to the best people in every part of Ireland which
      Ormond intended to visit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the course of Ormond's tour through Ireland, he frequently found
      himself in company with those who knew the history of public affairs for
      years past, and were but too well acquainted with the political profligacy
      and shameful jobbing of Sir Ulick O'Shane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these gentlemen, knowing Mr. Ormond to be his ward, refrained, of
      course, from touching upon any subject relative to Sir Ulick; and when
      Ormond mentioned him, evaded the conversation, or agreed in general terms
      in praising his abilities, wit, and address. But, after a day or two's
      journey from Castle Hermitage, when he was beyond his own and the
      adjoining counties, when he went into company with those who happened to
      know nothing of his connexion with Sir Ulick O'Shane, then he heard him
      spoken of in a very different manner. He was quite astonished and dismayed
      by the general abuse, as he thought it, which was poured upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, every man of abilities excites envy&mdash;every man who takes a
      part in politics, especially in times when parties run high, must expect
      to be abused: they must bear it; and their friends must learn to bear it
      for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the reflections with which Ormond at first comforted himself. As
      far as party abuse went, this was quite satisfactory; even facts, or what
      are told as facts, are so altered by the manner of seeing them by an
      opposite party, that, without meaning to traduce, they calumniate. Ormond
      entrenched himself in total disbelief, and cool assertion of his
      disbelief, of a variety of anecdotes he continually heard discreditable to
      Sir Ulick. Still he expected that, when he went into other company, and
      met with men of Sir Ulick's own party, he should obtain proofs of the
      falsehood of these stories, and by that he might be able, not only to
      contradict, but to confute them. People, however, only smiled, and told
      him that he had better inquire no farther, if he expected to find Sir
      Ulick an immaculate character. Those who liked him best, laughed off the
      notorious instances of his public defection of principle, and of his
      private jobbing, as good jokes; proofs of his knowledge of the world&mdash;his
      address, his frankness, his being "not a bit of a hypocrite." But even
      those who professed to like him best, and to be the least scrupulous with
      regard to public virtue, still spoke with a sort of facetious contempt of
      Sir Ulick, as a thorough-going friend of the powers that be&mdash;as a
      hack of administration&mdash;as a man who knew well enough what he was
      about. Ormond was continually either surprised or hurt by these
      insinuations. The concurrent testimony of numbers who had no interest to
      serve, or prejudice to gratify, operated upon him by degrees, so as to
      enforce conviction, and this was still more painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry became so sore and irritable upon this subject, that he was now
      every day in danger of entangling himself in some quarrel in defence of
      his guardian. Several times the master of the house prevented this, and
      brought him to reason, by representing that the persons who talked of Sir
      Ulick were quite ignorant of his connexion with him, and spoke only
      according to general opinion, and to the best of their belief, of a public
      character, who was fair game. It was, at that time, much the fashion among
      a certain set in Dublin, to try their wit upon each other in political and
      poetical squibs&mdash;the more severe and bitter these were, the more they
      were applauded: the talent for invective was in the highest demand at this
      period in Ireland; it was considered as the unequivocal proof of
      intellectual superiority. The display of it was the more admired, as it
      could not be enjoyed without a double portion of that personal promptitude
      to give the <i>satisfaction of a gentleman</i>, on which the Irish pride
      themselves: the taste of the nation, both for oratory and manners, has
      become of late years so much more refined, that when any of the lampoons
      of that day are now recollected, people are surprised at the licence of
      abuse which was then tolerated, and even approved of in fashionable
      society. Sir Ulick O'Shane, as a well-known public character, had been the
      subject of a variety of puns, bon-mots, songs, and epigrams, which had
      become so numerous as to be collected under the title of Ulysseana. Upon
      the late separation of Sir Ulick and his lady, a new edition, with a
      caricature frontispiece, had been published; unfortunately for Ormond,
      this had just worked its way from Dublin to this part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one day, at a gentleman's house where this Ulysseana had not
      yet been seen, that a lady, a visitor and a stranger, full of some of the
      lines which she had learned by heart, began to repeat them for the
      amusement of the tea-table. Ladies do not always consider how much
      mischief they may do by such imprudence; nor how they may hazard valuable
      lives, for the sake of producing a <i>sensation</i>, by the repetition of
      <i>a severe thing</i>. Ormond came into the room after dinner, and with
      some other gentlemen gathered round the tea-table, while the lady was
      repeating some extracts from the new edition of the Ulysseana. The master
      and mistress of the house made reiterated attempts to stop the lady; but,
      too intent upon herself and her second-hand wit to comprehend or take
      these hints, she went on reciting the following lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To serve in parliament the nation,
  Sir Ulick read his recantation:

    At first he joined the patriot throng,
    But soon perceiving he was wrong,
    He ratted to the courtier tribe,
    Bought by a title and a bribe;
    But how that new found friend to bind,
    With any oath&mdash;of any kind,
    Disturb'd the premier's wary mind.
    "<i>Upon his faith.&mdash;Upon his word,</i>"
    Oh! that, my friend, is too absurd.
    "<i>Upon his honour</i>."&mdash;Quite a jest.
    "<i>Upon his conscience</i>."&mdash;No such test.
    "<i>By all he has on earth</i>."&mdash;'Tis gone.
    "<i>By all his hopes of Heaven</i>."&mdash;They're none.
    "How then secure him in our pay&mdash;
    He can't be trusted for a day?"
    How?&mdash;When you want the fellow's throat&mdash;
    Pay by the job&mdash;you have his vote.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick himself, had he been present, would have laughed off the epigram
      with the best grace imaginable, and so, in good policy, ought Ormond to
      have taken it. But he felt it too much, and was not in the habit of
      laughing when he was vexed. Most of the company, who knew any thing of his
      connexion with Sir Ulick, or who understood the agonizing looks of the
      master and mistress of the house, politely refrained from smiles or
      applause; but a cousin of the lady who repeated the lines, a young man who
      was one of the hateful tribe of <i>quizzers</i>, on purpose to <i>try</i>
      Ormond, praised the verses to the skies, and appealed to him for his
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't admire them, sir," replied Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What fault can you find with them?" said the young man, winking at the
      bystanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think them <i>incorrect</i>, in the first place, sir," said Ormond,
      "and altogether indifferent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, at any rate, they can't be called <i>moderate</i>," said the
      gentleman; "and as to incorrect, the substance, I fancy, is correctly
      true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Fancy</i>, sir!&mdash;It would be hard if character were to be at the
      mercy of fancy," cried Ormond, hastily; but checking himself, he, in a
      mild tone, added, "before we go any farther, sir, I should inform you that
      I am a ward of Sir Ulick O Shane's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! mercy," exclaimed the lady, who had repeated the verses; "I am sure I
      did not know that, or I would not have said a word&mdash;I declare I beg
      your pardon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's bow and smile spoke his perfect satisfaction with the lady's
      contrition, and his desire to relieve her from farther anxiety. So the
      matter might have happily ended; but her cousin, though he had begun
      merely with an intention to try Ormond's temper, now felt piqued by his
      spirit, and thought it incumbent upon him to persist. Having drunk enough
      to be ill-humoured, he replied, in an aggravating and ill-bred manner,
      "Your being Sir Ulick O'Shane's ward may make a difference in your
      feelings, sir, but I don't see why it should make any in my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the expression of that opinion at least, sir, I think it ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house now interfered, to explain and pacify, and Ormond
      had presence of mind and command enough over himself, to say no more while
      the ladies were present: he sat down, and began talking about some trifle
      in a gay tone; but his flushed cheek, and altered manner, showed that he
      was only repressing other feelings. The carriages of the visitors were
      announced, and the strangers rose to depart. Ormond accompanied the master
      of the house to hand the ladies to their carriages. To mark his being in
      perfect charity with the fair penitent, he showed her particular
      attention, which quite touched her; and as he put her into her carriage,
      she, all the time, repeated her apologies, declared it should be a lesson
      to her for life, and cordially shook hands with him at parting. For her
      sake, he wished that nothing more should be said on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on his return to the hall, he found there the cousin, buttoning on
      his great coat, and seeming loath to depart: still in ill-humour, the
      gentleman said, "I hope you are satisfied with that lady's apologies, Mr.
      Ormond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, sir, perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's lucky: for apologies are easier had from ladies than gentlemen,
      and become them better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it becomes gentlemen as well as ladies to make candid apologies,
      where they are conscious of being wrong&mdash;if there was no intention to
      give offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>If</i> is a great peace-maker, sir; but I scorn to take advantage of
      an <i>if</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to suppose then, sir," said Ormond, "that it was your intention to
      offend me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose what you please, sir&mdash;I am not in the habit of explanation
      or apology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, the sooner we meet the better," said Ormond. In consequence
      Ormond applied to an officer who had been present during the altercation,
      to be his second. Ormond felt that he had restrained his anger
      sufficiently&mdash;he was now as firm as he had been temperate. The
      parties met and fought: the man who deserved to have suffered, by the
      chance of this rational mode of deciding right and wrong, escaped unhurt;
      Ormond received a wound in his arm. It was only a flesh wound. He was at
      the house of a very hospitable gentleman, whose family were kind to him;
      and the inconvenience and pain were easily borne. In the opinion of all,
      in that part of the world, who knew the facts, he had conducted himself as
      well as the circumstances would permit; and, as it was essential, not only
      to the character of a hero, but of a gentleman at that time in Ireland, to
      fight a duel, we may consider Ormond as fortunate in not having been in
      the wrong. He rose in favour with the ladies, and in credit with the
      gentlemen, and he heard no more of the Ulysseana; but he was concerned to
      see paragraphs in all the Irish papers, about the duel that had been
      fought between M. N. Esq. jun. of &mdash;&mdash;, and H. O. Esq., in
      consequence of a dispute that arose about some satirical verses, repeated
      by a lady on a certain well-known character, nearly related to one of the
      parties. A flaming account of the duel followed, in which there was the
      usual newspaper proportion of truth and falsehood: Ormond knew and
      regretted that this paragraph must meet the eyes of his guardian; and
      still more he was sorry that Dr. Cambray should see it. He knew the
      doctor's Christian abhorrence of the whole system of duelling; and, by the
      statement in the papers, it appeared that that gallant youth, H. O. Esq.,
      to whom the news-writer evidently wished to do honour, had been far more
      forward to provoke the fight than he had been, or than he ought to have
      been:&mdash;his own plain statement of facts, which he wrote to Dr.
      Cambray, would have set every thing to rights, but his letter crossed the
      doctor's on the road. As he was now in a remote place, which the
      delightful mail coach roads had not then reached&mdash;where the post came
      in only three days in the week&mdash;and where the mail cart either broke
      down, lost a wheel, had a tired horse, was overturned, or robbed, at an
      average once a fortnight&mdash;our hero had no alternative but patience,
      and the amusement of calculating dates and chances upon his restless sofa.
      His taste for reading enabled him to pass agreeably some of the hours of
      bodily confinement, which men, and young men especially, accustomed to a
      great deal of exercise, liberty, and locomotion, generally find so
      intolerably irksome. At length his wound was well enough for him to travel&mdash;letters
      for him arrived: a warm, affectionate one from his guardian; and one from
      Dr. Cambray, which relieved his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must tell you, my dear young friend," said Dr. Cambray, "that while you
      have been defending Sir Ulick O'Shane's public character (of which,
      by-the-by, you know nothing), I have been defending your private
      character, of which I hope and believe I know something. The truth is
      always known in time, with regard to every character; and therefore,
      independently of other motives, moral and religious, it is more prudent to
      trust to time and truth for their defence, than to sword and pistol. I
      know you are impatient to hear what were the reports to your disadvantage,
      and from whom I had them. I had them from the Annalys; and they heard them
      in England, through various circuitous channels of female correspondents
      in Ireland. As far as we can trace them, we think that they originated
      with your old friend Miss Black. The first account Lady Annaly heard of
      you after she went to England, was, that you were living a most dissolute
      life in the Black Islands, with King Corny, who was described to be a
      profligate rebel, and his companion an ex-communicated catholic priest;
      king, priest, and <i>Prince Harry</i>, getting drunk together regularly
      every night of their lives. The next account which Lady Annaly received
      some months afterwards, in reply to inquiries she had made from her agent,
      was, that it was impossible to know any thing for certain of Mr. Harry
      Ormond, as he always kept in the Black Islands. The report was, that he
      had lately seduced a girl of the name of Peggy Sheridan, a respectable
      gardener's daughter, who was going to be married to a man of the name of
      Moriarty Carroll, a person whom Mr. Ormond had formerly shot in some
      unfortunate drunken quarrel. The match between her and Moriarty had been
      broken off in consequence. The following year accounts were worse and
      worse. This Harry Ormond had gained the affections of his benefactor's
      daughter, though, as he had been warned by her father, she was betrothed
      to another man. The young lady was afterwards, by her father's anger, and
      by Ormond's desertion of her, thrown into the arms of a French adventurer,
      whom Ormond brought into the house under pretence of learning French from
      him. Immediately after the daughter's elopement with the French master,
      the poor father died suddenly, in some extraordinary manner, when out
      shooting with this Mr. Ormond; to whom a considerable landed property, and
      a large legacy in money, were, to every body's surprise, found to be left
      in a will which <i>he</i> produced, and which the family did not think fit
      to dispute. There were strange circumstances told concerning the wake and
      burial, all tending to prove that this Harry Ormond had lost all feeling.
      Hints were further given that he had renounced the Protestant religion,
      and had turned Catholic for the sake of absolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times during the perusal of this extravagant tissue of falsehoods,
      Ormond laid down and resumed the paper, unable to refrain from
      exclamations of rage and contempt; sometimes almost laughing at the
      absurdity of the slander. "After this," thought he, "who can mind common
      reports?&mdash;and yet Dr. Cambray says that these excited some prejudice
      against me in the mind of Lady Annaly. With such a woman I should have
      thought it impossible. Could she believe me capable of such crimes?&mdash;<i>me</i>,
      of whom she had once a good opinion?&mdash;<i>me</i>, in whose fate she
      said she was interested?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Dr. Cambray's letter again, and read on: he found that Lady Annaly
      had not credited these reports as to the atrocious accusations; but they
      had so far operated as to excite doubts and suspicions. In some of the
      circumstances, there was sufficient truth to colour the falsehood. For
      example, with regard both to Peggy Sheridan, and Dora, the truth had been
      plausibly mixed with falsehood. The story of Peggy Sheridan, Lady Annaly
      had some suspicion might be true. Her ladyship, who had seen Moriarty's
      generous conduct to Ormond, was indignant at his ingratitude. She was a
      woman prompt to feel strong indignation against all that was base; and,
      when her indignation was excited, she was sometimes incapable of hearing
      what was said on the other side of the question. Her daughter Florence, of
      a calmer temper and cooler judgment, usually acted as moderator on these
      occasions. She could not believe that Harry Ormond had been guilty of
      faults that were so opposite to those which they had seen in his
      disposition:&mdash;violence, not treachery, was his fault. But why, if
      there were nothing wrong, Lady Annaly urged&mdash;why did not he write to
      her, as she had requested he would, when his plans for his future life
      were decided?&mdash;She had told him that her son might probably be able
      to assist him. Why could not he write one line?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had heard that her son was ill, and that her mind was so absorbed
      with anxiety, that he could not at first venture to intrude upon her with
      his selfish concerns. This was his first and best reason; but afterwards,
      to be sure, when he heard that the son was better, he might have written.
      He wrote at that time such a sad scrawl of a hand&mdash;he was so little
      used to letter-writing, that he was ashamed to write. Then it was <i>too
      late</i> after so long a silence, &amp;c. Foolish as these reasons were,
      they had, as we have said before, acted upon our young hero; and have,
      perhaps, in as important circumstances, prevented many young men from
      writing to friends, able and willing to serve them. It was rather
      fortunate for Ormond that slander did not stop at the first plausible
      falsehoods: when the more atrocious charges came against him, Miss Annaly,
      who had never deserted his cause, declared her absolute disbelief. The
      discussions that went on, between her and her mother, kept alive their
      interest about this young man. He was likely to have been forgotten during
      their anxiety in the son's illness; but fresh reports had brought him to
      their recollection frequently; and when their friend, Dr. Cambray, was
      appointed to the living of Castle Hermitage, his evidence perfectly
      reinstated Harry in Lady Annaly's good opinion. As if to make amends for
      the injustice she had done him by believing any part of the evil reports,
      she was now anxious to see him again. A few days after Dr. Cambray wrote,
      Ormond received a very polite and gratifying letter from Lady Annaly,
      requesting that, as "Annaly" lay in his route homewards, he would spend a
      few days there, and give her an opportunity of making him acquainted with
      her son. It is scarcely necessary to say that this invitation was eagerly
      accepted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon his arrival at Annaly, Ormond found that Dr. Cambray and all his
      family were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, all your friends," said Lady Annaly, as Ormond looked round with
      pleasure, "all your friends, Mr. Ormond&mdash;you must allow me an old
      right to be of that number&mdash;and here is my son, who is as well
      inclined, as I hope you feel, to pass over the intermediate formality of
      new acquaintanceship, and to become intimate with you as soon as
      possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert Annaly confirmed, by the polite cordiality of his manner, all
      that his mother promised; adding that their mutual friend Dr. Cambray had
      made him already so fully acquainted with Mr. Ormond, that though he had
      never had the pleasure of seeing him before, he could not consider him as
      a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence Annaly was beautiful, but not one of those beauties who strike at
      first sight. Hers was a face which neither challenged nor sued for
      admiration. There was no expression thrown into the eyes or the eyebrows,
      no habitual smile on the lips&mdash;the features were all in natural
      repose; the face never expressed any thing but what the mind really felt.
      But if any just observation was made in Miss Annaly's company, any stroke
      of genius, that countenance instantly kindled into light and life: and if
      any noble sentiment was expressed, if any generous action was related,
      then the soul within illumined the countenance with a ray divine. When
      once Ormond had seen this, his eye returned in hopes of seeing it again&mdash;he
      had an indescribable interest and pleasure in studying a countenance,
      which seemed so true an index to a noble and cultivated mind, to a heart
      of delicate, but not morbid sensibility. His manners and understanding had
      been formed and improved, beyond what could have been expected, from the
      few opportunities of improvement he had till lately enjoyed. He was timid,
      however, in conversation with those of whose information and abilities he
      had a high opinion, so that at first he did not do himself justice; but in
      his timidity there was no awkwardness; it was joined with such firmness of
      principle, and such a resolute, manly character, that he was peculiarly
      engaging to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his first visit at Annaly he pleased much, and was so much pleased
      with every individual of the family, with their manners, their
      conversation, their affection for each other, and altogether with their
      mode of living, that he declared to Dr. Cambray he never had been so happy
      in his whole existence. It was a remarkable fact, however, that he spoke
      much more of Lady Annaly and Sir Herbert than of Miss Annaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never before felt so very unwilling to leave any place, or so
      exceedingly anxious to be invited to repeat his visit. He did receive the
      wished-for invitation; and it was given in such a manner as left him no
      doubt that he might indulge his own ardent desire to return, and to
      cultivate the friendship of this family. His ardour for foreign travel,
      his desire to see more of the world, greatly abated; and before he reached
      Castle Hermitage, and by the time he saw his guardian, he had almost
      forgotten that Sir Ulick had traced for him a course of travels through
      the British islands and the most polished parts of the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now told Sir Ulick that it was so far advanced in the season, that he
      thought it better to spend the winter in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Dublin instead of London?" said Sir Ulick, smiling; "very patriotic,
      and very kind to me, for I am sure I am your first object; and depend upon
      it few people, ladies always excepted, will ever like your company better
      than I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sir Ulick went rapidly over every subject, and every person, that
      could lead his ward farther to explain his feelings; but now, as usual, he
      wasted his address, for the ingenuous young man directly opened his whole
      heart to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am impatient to tell you, sir," said he, "how very kindly I was
      received by Lady Annaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very kind," said Sir Ulick: "I suppose, in general, you have found
      yourself pretty well received wherever you have gone&mdash;not to flatter
      you too much on your mental or personal qualifications, and, no
      disparagement to Dr. Cambray's letters of introduction or my own, five or
      six thousand a-year are, I have generally observed, a tolerably good
      passport into society, a sufficient passe-partout." "Passe-partout!&mdash;not
      <i>partout</i>&mdash;not quite sufficient at Annaly, you cannot mean, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I cannot mean any thing, but that Annaly is altogether the eighth
      wonder of the world," said Sir Ulick, "and all the men and women in it
      absolutely angels&mdash;perfect angels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, if you please, not perfect; for I have heard&mdash;though I own
      I never saw it&mdash;that perfection is always stupid: now certainly <i>that</i>
      the Annalys are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, they shall be as imperfect as you like&mdash;any thing to
      please you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir, you used to be so fond of the Annalys. I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, and did I tell you that I had changed my opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your manner, though not your words, tells me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake: the fact is&mdash;for I always treat you, Harry, with
      perfect candour&mdash;I was hurt and vexed by their refusal of my son.
      But, after all," added he, with a deep sigh, "it was Marcus's own fault&mdash;he
      has been very dissipated. Miss Annaly was right, and her mother quite
      right, I own. Lady Annaly is one of the most respectable women in Ireland&mdash;and
      Miss Annaly is a charming girl&mdash;I never saw any girl I should have
      liked so much for my daughter-in-law. But Marcus and I don't always agree
      in our tastes&mdash;I don't think the refusal there, was half as great a
      mortification and disappointment to him, as it was to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You delight me, dear sir," cried Ormond; "for then I may feel secure that
      if ever in future&mdash;I don't mean in the least that I have any present
      thought&mdash;it would be absurd&mdash;it would be ridiculous&mdash;it
      would be quite improper&mdash;you know I was only there ten days; but I
      mean if, in future, I should ever have any thoughts&mdash;any serious
      thoughts&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said Sir Ulick, laughing at Ormond's hesitation and
      embarrassment, "I can suppose that you will have thoughts of some kind or
      other, and serious thoughts in due course; but, as you justly observe, it
      would be quite ridiculous at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, sir," interrupted Harry, "but it would even at present
      be an inexpressible satisfaction to me to know, that if in future such a
      thing should occur, I should be secure, in the first place, of your
      approbation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, my dear boy," said Sir Ulick, "you know in a few days you
      will be at years of discretion&mdash;then my control ceases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; but not my anxiety for your approbation, and my deference for
      your opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Sir Ulick, "and without circumlocution or nonsense, I tell
      you at once, Harry Ormond, that Florence Annaly is the woman in the world
      I should like best to see your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir, for this explicit answer&mdash;I am sure towards me
      nothing can have been more candid and kind than your whole conduct has
      ever been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true, Harry," exclaimed Sir Ulick. "Tell me about this duel&mdash;you
      have fought a duel in defence of my conduct and character, I understand,
      since I saw you. But, my dear fellow, though I am excessively obliged to
      you, I am exceedingly angry with you: how could you possibly be so
      hot-heated and silly as to <i>take up</i> any man for relishing the
      Ulysseana? Bless ye! I relish it myself&mdash;I only laugh at such things:
      believe me, 'tis The best way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of it, sir, if one can; and, indeed, I have had pretty good
      proof that one should despise reports and scandal of all kinds&mdash;easier
      for oneself sometimes than for one's friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear Ormond, by the time you have been half as long living in the
      great and the political world as I have been, you will be quite
      case-hardened, and will hear your friends abused, without feeling it in
      the least. Believe me, I once was troubled with a great deal of
      susceptibility like yours&mdash;but after all, 'tis no bad thing for you
      to have fought a duel&mdash;a feather in your cap with the ladies, and a
      warning to all impertinent fellows to let you alone&mdash;but you were
      wounded, the newspaper said&mdash;I asked you where, three times in my
      letters&mdash;you never condescended to answer me&mdash;answer me now, I
      insist upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my arm, sir&mdash;a slight scratch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slight scratch or not, I must hear all about it&mdash;come, tell me
      exactly how the thing began and ended&mdash;tell me all the rascals said
      of me.&mdash;You won't?&mdash;then I'll tell you: they said, 'I am the
      greatest jobber in Ireland&mdash;that I do not mind how I throw away the
      public money&mdash;in short, that I am a sad political profligate.'&mdash;Well!
      well! I am sure, after all, they did me the justice to acknowledge, that
      in private life no man's honour is more to be depended on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did do you that justice, sir," said Ormond; "but pray ask me no
      farther questions&mdash;for, frankly, it is disagreeable to me&mdash;and I
      will tell you no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's frank," said Sir Ulick, "and I as frankly assure you I am
      perfectly satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, to return to the Annalys," said Ormond, "I never saw Sir Herbert
      till now&mdash;I like him&mdash;I like his principles&mdash;his love of
      his country&mdash;and his attachment to his family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a very fine fellow&mdash;no better fellow than Herbert Annaly. But
      as for his attachment to his family, who thanks him for that? Who could
      help it, with such a family? And his love for his country&mdash;every body
      loves his country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More or less, I suppose," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, upon my word, I entirely agree with you about Sir Herbert, though I
      know he is prejudiced against me to the last degree"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he be, I don't know it, sir&mdash;I never found it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will let it out by and by&mdash;I only hope he will not prejudice you
      against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not very easily done, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you have given some proof, my dear boy, and I thank you for it. But
      the Annalys would go more cautiously to work&mdash;I only put you on your
      guard&mdash;Marcus and Sir Herbert never could hit it off together; and I
      am afraid the breach between us and the Annalys must he widened, for
      Marcus must stand against Sir Herbert at the next election, if he live&mdash;Pray
      how is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not strong, sir&mdash;he has a hectic colour&mdash;as I was very sorry to
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, poor fellow&mdash;he broke some blood-vessel, I think Marcus told me,
      when they were in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir&mdash;so Lady Annaly told me&mdash;it was in over-exerting
      himself to extinguish a fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very fine spirited fellow he is, no doubt," said Sir Ulick; "but, after
      all, that was rather a foolish thing, in his state of health. By-the-by,
      as your guardian, it is my duty to explain the circumstances of this
      family&mdash;in case you should hereafter <i>have any serious thoughts</i>;
      as you say, you should know what comforted Marcus in his disappointment
      there. There is, then, some confounded flaw in that old father's will,
      through which the great Herbert estate slips to an heir-at-law, who has
      started up within this twelvemonth. Miss Annaly, who was to have been a
      nonpareil of an heiress in case of the brother's death, will have but a
      moderate fortune; and the poor dowager will be but scantily provided for,
      after all the magnificence which she has been used to, unless he lives to
      make up something handsome for them. I don't know the particulars, but I
      know that a vast deal depends on his living till he has levied certain
      fines, which he ought to have levied, instead of amusing himself putting
      out other people's fires. But I am excessively anxious about it, and now
      on your account as well as theirs; for it would make a great difference to
      you, if you seriously have any <i>thoughts</i> of Miss Annaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond declared this could make no difference to him, since his own
      fortune would be sufficient for all the wishes of such a woman as he
      supposed Miss Annaly to be. The next day Marcus O'Shane arrived from
      England. This was the first time that Ormond and he had met since the
      affair of Moriarty, and the banishment from Castle Hermitage. The meeting
      was awkward enough, notwithstanding Sir Ulick's attempts to make it
      otherwise: Marcus laboured under the double consciousness of having
      deserted Harry in past adversity, and of being jealous of his present
      prosperity. Ormond at first went forward to meet him more than half way
      with great cordiality, but the cold politeness of Marcus chilled him; and
      the heartless congratulations, and frequent allusions in the course of the
      first hour, to Ormond's new fortune and consequence, offended our young
      hero's pride. He grew more reserved, the more complimentary Marcus became,
      especially as in all his compliments there was a mixture of <i>persiflage</i>,
      which Marcus supposed, erroneously, that Ormond's untutored, unpractised
      ear would not perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry sat silent, proudly indignant. He valued himself on being something,
      and somebody, independently of his fortune&mdash;he had worked hard to
      become so&mdash;he had the consciousness about him of tried integrity,
      resolution, and virtue; and was it to be implied that he was <i>somebody</i>,
      only in consequence of his having chanced to become heir to so many
      thousands a year? Sir Ulick, whose address was equal to most occasions,
      was not able to manage so as to make these young men like one another.
      Marcus had an old jealousy of Harry's favour with his father, of his
      father's affection for Harry: and at the present moment, he was conscious
      that his father was with just cause much displeased with him. Of this
      Harry knew nothing, but Marcus suspected that his father had told Ormond
      every thing, and this increased the awkwardness and ill-humour that Marcus
      felt; and notwithstanding all his knowledge of the world, and conventional
      politeness, he showed his vexation in no very well-bred manner. He was now
      in particularly bad humour, in consequence of a <i>scrape</i>, as he
      called it, which he had got into, during his last winter in London,
      respecting an intrigue with a married lady of rank. Marcus, by some
      intemperate expressions, had brought on the discovery, of which, when it
      was too late, he repented. A public trial was likely to be the consequence&mdash;the
      damages would doubtless be laid at the least at ten thousand pounds.
      Marcus, however, counting, as sons sometimes do in calculating their
      father's fortune, all the credit, and knowing nothing of the debtor side
      of the account, conceived his father's wealth to be inexhaustible. Lady
      O'Shane's large fortune had cleared off all debts, and had set Sir Ulick
      up in a bank, which was in high credit; then he had shares in a canal and
      in a silver mine&mdash;he held two lucrative sinecure places&mdash;and had
      bought estates in three counties: but the son did not know, that for the
      borrowed purchase-money of two of the estates Sir Ulick was now paying
      high and accumulating interest; so that the prospect of being called upon
      for ten thousand pounds was most alarming. In this exigency Sir Ulick, who
      had long foreseen how the affair was likely to terminate, had his eye upon
      his ward's ready money. It was for this he had been at such peculiar pains
      to ingratiate himself with Ormond. Affection, nevertheless, made him
      hesitate; he was unwilling to injure or to hazard his property&mdash;very
      unwilling to prey upon his generosity&mdash;still more so after the late
      handsome manner in which Ormond had hazarded his life in defence of his
      guardian's honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick, who perceived the first evening that Marcus and Ormond met,
      that the former was not going the way to assist these views, pointed out
      to him how much it was for his interest to conciliate Ormond, and to
      establish himself in his good opinion; but Marcus, though he saw and
      acknowledged this, could not submit his pride and temper to the necessary
      restraint. For a few hours he would display his hereditary talents, and
      all his acquired graces; but the next hour his ill-humour would break out
      towards his inferiors, his father's tenants and dependents, in a way which
      Ormond's generous spirit could not bear. Before he went to England, even
      from his boyish days, his manners had been habitually haughty and
      tyrannical to the lower class of people. Ormond and he had always differed
      and often quarrelled on this subject. Ormond hoped to find his manners
      altered in this respect by his residence in a more polished country. But
      the external polish he had acquired had not reached the mind: high-bred
      society had taught him only to be polite to his equals; he was now still
      more disposed to be insolent to his inferiors, especially to his Irish
      inferiors. He affected to consider himself as more than half an
      Englishman; and returning from London in all the distress and disgrace to
      which he had reduced himself by criminal indulgence in the vices of
      fashionable, and what he called <i>refined</i>, society, he vented his
      ill-humour on the poor Irish peasants&mdash;the <i>natives</i>, as he
      termed them in derision. He spoke to them as if they were slaves&mdash;he
      considered them as savages. Marcus had, early in life, almost before he
      knew the real distinctions, or more than the names of the different
      parties in Ireland, been a strong party man. He called himself a
      government man; but he was one of those partisans, whom every wise and
      good administration in Ireland has discountenanced and disclaimed. He was,
      in short, one of those who make their politics an excuse to their
      conscience for the indulgence of a violent temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond was indignant at the inveterate prejudice that Marcus showed
      against a poor man, whom he had injured, but who had never injured him.
      The moment Marcus saw Moriarty Carroll again, and heard his name
      mentioned, he exclaimed and reiterated, "That's a bad fellow&mdash;I know
      him of old&mdash;all those Carrolls are rascals and rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcus looked with a sort of disdainful spleen at the house which Ormond
      had fitted up for Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you stick to this fellow still!&mdash;What a dupe, Ormond, this
      Moriarty has made of you!" said Marcus; "but that's not my affair. I only
      wonder how you wheedled my father out of the ground for the garden here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no wheedling in the case," said Ormond: "your father gave it
      freely, or I should not have accepted it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were very good to accept it, no doubt," said Marcus, in an ironical
      tone: "I know I have asked my father for a garden to a cottage before now,
      and have been refused."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick came up just as this was said, and, alarmed at the tone of
      voice, used all his address to bring his son back to good temper; and he
      might have succeeded, but that Peggy Carroll chanced to appear at that
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that?" cried Marcus&mdash;"Peggy Sheridan, as I live! is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, please your honour, but Peggy Sheridan that was&mdash;Peggy Carroll
      <i>that is</i>," said Peggy, curtsying, with a slight blush, and an arch
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you have married that Moriarty at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, please your honour&mdash;he is a very honest boy&mdash;and I'm
      very happy&mdash;if your honour's pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who persuaded your father to this, pray, contrary to my advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody at all, plase your honour," said Peggy, looking frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say that, Peggy," said Ormond, "when you know it was I who
      persuaded your father to give his consent to your marriage with Moriarty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! Mr. Ormond!&mdash;Oh, I comprehend it all now," said Marcus, with
      his sneering look and tone: "no doubt you had good reasons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Peggy blushed the deepest crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand it all now," said Marcus&mdash;"I understand you now,
      Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's anger rose, and with a look of high disdain, he replied, "You
      understand me, now! No, nor ever will, nor ever can. Our minds are
      unintelligible to each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning from him, Ormond walked away with indignant speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peggy, don't I see something like a cow yonder, <i>getting her bread</i>
      at my expense?" said Sir Ulick, directing Peggy's eye to a gap in the
      hedge by the road-side. "Whose cow is that at the top of the ditch, half
      through my hedge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say, please your honour," said Peggy, "if it wouldn't be Paddy
      M'Grath's&mdash;Betty M'Gregor!" cried she, calling to a bare-footed girl,
      "whose cow is yonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, marcy! but if it isn't our own red rogue&mdash;and when I tied her
      legs three times myself, the day!" said the girl, running to drive away
      the cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! she strays and trespasses strangely, the red cow, for want of the
      little spot your honour promised her," said Peggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, run and save my hedge from her now, my pretty Peggy, and I will
      find the little spot for her to-morrow," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away ran Peggy after the cow&mdash;while lowering Marcus cursed them all
      three. Pretty Peg he swore ought to be banished the estate&mdash;the cow
      ought to be hamstrung instead of having <i>a spot</i> promised her; "but
      this is the way, sir, you ruin the country and the people," said he to his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be that as it may, I do not ruin myself as you do, Marcus," replied the
      cool Sir Ulick. "Never mind the cow&mdash;nonsense! I am not thinking of a
      cow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I neither, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then follow Harry Ormond directly, and make him understand that he
      misunderstood you," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, sir&mdash;I cannot bend to him," said Marcus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you expect that he will lend you ten thousand pounds at your utmost
      need?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The money, with your estate, can be easily raised elsewhere, sir," said
      Marcus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you it cannot, sir," said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot bend to Ormond, sir: to any body but him&mdash;any thing but
      that&mdash;my pride cannot stoop to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pride!&mdash;'pride that licks the dust,'" thought Sir Ulick. It was
      in vain for the politic father to remonstrate with the headstrong son. The
      whole train which Sir Ulick had laid with so much skill, was, he feared,
      at the moment when his own delicate hand was just preparing to give the
      effective touch, blown up by the rude impatience of his son. Sir Ulick,
      however, never lost time or opportunity in vain regret for the past. Even
      in the moment of disappointment, he looked to the future. He saw the
      danger of keeping two young men together, who had such incompatible
      tempers and characters. He was, therefore, glad when he met Ormond again,
      to hear him propose his returning to Annaly, and he instantly acceded to
      the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Castle Hermitage, I know, my dear boy, cannot be as pleasant to you just
      now, as I could wish to make it: we have nobody here now, and Marcus is
      not all I could wish him," said Sir Ulick, with a sigh. "He had always a
      jealousy of my affection for you, Harry&mdash;it cannot be helped&mdash;we
      do not choose our own children&mdash;but we must abide by them&mdash;you
      must perceive that things are not going on quite rightly between my son
      and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry for it, sir; especially as I am convinced I can do no good,
      and therefore wish not to interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are right&mdash;though I part from you with regret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be within your reach, sir, you know: whenever you wish for me, if
      ever I can be of the least use to <i>you</i>, summon me, and I am at your
      orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you! but stay one moment," said Sir Ulick, with a sudden look of
      recollection: "you will be of age in a few days, Harry&mdash;we ought to
      settle accounts, should not we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever you please, sir&mdash;no hurry on my part&mdash;but you have
      advanced me a great deal of money lately&mdash;I ought to settle that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, as to that&mdash;a mere trifle. If you are in no hurry, I am in none;
      for I shall have business enough on my hands during these few days, before
      Lady Norton fills the house again with company&mdash;I am certainly a
      little hurried now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, do not think of my business&mdash;I cannot be better off, you
      know, than I am&mdash;I assure you I am sensible of that. Never mind the
      accounts&mdash;only send for me whenever I can be of any use or pleasure
      to you. I need not make speeches: I trust, my dear guardian&mdash;my
      father, when I was left fatherless&mdash;I trust you believe I have some
      gratitude in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," cried Sir Ulick, much moved; "and, by Heaven, it is impossible to&mdash;I
      mean&mdash;in short, it is impossible not to love you, Harry Ormond."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are people who can go on very smoothly with those whose principles
      and characters they despise and dislike. There are people who, provided
      they live in <i>company</i>, are happy, and care but little of what the
      company is composed. But our young hero certainly was not one of these
      contented people. He was perhaps too much in the other extreme. He could
      not, without overt words or looks of indignation, endure the presence of
      those whose characters or principles he despised&mdash;he could not, even
      without manifest symptoms of restlessness or ennui, submit long to live
      with mere companions; he required to have friends; nor could he make a
      friend from ordinary materials, however smooth the grain, or however fine
      the polish they might take. Even when the gay world at Castle Hermitage
      was new to him&mdash;amused and enchanted as he was at first with that
      brilliant society, he could not have been content or happy without his
      friends at Vicar's Dale, to whom, once at least in the four-and-twenty
      hours, he found it necessary to open his heart. We may then judge how
      happy he now felt in returning to Annaly: after the sort of moral
      constraint which he had endured in the company of Marcus O'Shane, we may
      guess what an expansion of heart took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family union and domestic happiness which he saw at Annaly, certainly
      struck him at this time more forcibly, from the contrast with what he had
      just seen at Castle Hermitage. The effect of contrast, however, is but
      transient. It is powerful as a dramatic resource, but in real life it is
      of no permanent consequence. There was here a charm which operates with as
      great certainty, and with a power secure of increasing instead of
      diminishing from habit&mdash;the charm of <i>domestic politeness</i>, in
      the every day manners of this mother, son, and daughter, towards each
      other, as well as towards their guests. Ormond saw and felt it
      irresistibly. He saw the most delicate attentions combined with entire
      sincerity, perfect ease, and constant respect; the result of the early
      habits of good-breeding acting upon the feelings of genuine affection. The
      external polish, which Ormond now admired, was very different from that
      varnish which often is hastily applied to hide imperfections. This polish
      was of the substance itself, to be obtained only by long use; but, once
      acquired, lasting for ever: not only beautiful, but serviceable,
      preserving from the injuries of time and from the dangers of familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What influence the sister's charms might have to increase Ormond's
      admiration of the brother, we shall not presume to determine; but
      certainly he liked Sir Herbert Annaly better than any young man he had
      ever seen. Sir Herbert was some years older than Ormond; he was in his
      twenty-seventh year: but at this age he had done more good in life than
      many men accomplish during their whole existence. Sir Herbert's principal
      estates were in another part of Ireland. Dr. Cambray had visited them. The
      account he gave Ormond of what had been done there, to improve the people
      and to make them happy; of the prosperous state of the peasantry; their
      industry and independence; their grateful, not servile, attachment to Sir
      Herbert Annaly and his mother; the veneration in which the name of Annaly
      was held; all delighted the enthusiastic Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Annaly was growing wonderfully dear to him; and, all of a
      sudden, the interest he felt in the details of a country gentleman's life
      was amazingly increased. At times, when the ladies were engaged, he
      accompanied Sir Herbert in visiting his estate. Sir Herbert had never till
      lately resided at Annaly, which had, within but a short time, reverted to
      his possession, in consequence of the death of the person to whom it had
      been let. He found much that wanted improvement in the land, and more in
      the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This estate stretched along the sea-shore: the tenants whom he found
      living near the coast were an idle, profligate, desperate set of people;
      who, during the time of the late middle landlord, had been in the habit of
      <i>making their rents</i> by nefarious practices. The best of the set were
      merely idle fishermen, whose habits of trusting to their <i>luck</i>
      incapacitated them from industry: the others were illicit distillers&mdash;smugglers&mdash;and
      miscreants who lived by <i>waifs</i> and <i>strays</i>; in fact, by the
      pillage of vessels on the coast. The coast was dangerous&mdash;there
      happened frequent shipwrecks; owing partly, as was supposed, to the false
      lights hung out by these people, whose interest it was that vessels should
      be wrecked. Shocked at these practices, Sir Herbert Annaly had, from the
      moment he came into possession of the estate, exerted himself to put a
      stop to them, and to punish, where he could not reform the offenders. The
      people at first pleaded a sort of <i>tenant's right</i>, which they
      thought a landlord could scarcely resist. They protested that they could
      not make <i>the rent</i>, if they were not allowed to make it in their own
      way; and showed, beyond a doubt, that Sir Herbert could not get half as
      much rent for his land in those parts, if he looked too scrupulously into
      the means by which it was made. They brought, in corroboration of their
      arguments or assertions, the example and constant practice of "many as
      good a jantleman as any in Ireland, who had his rent made up for him that
      ways, very ready and punctual. There was his honour, Mr. Such-a-one, and
      so on; and there was Sir Ulick O'Shane, sure! Oh! he was the man to live
      under&mdash;he was the man that knew when to wink and when to blink; and
      if he shut his eyes <i>properly</i>, sure his tenants filled his fist. Oh!
      Sir Ulick was the great man for <i>favour and purtection</i>, none like
      him at all!&mdash;He is the good landlord, that will fight the way clear
      for his own tenants through thick and thin&mdash;none dare touch them. Oh!
      Sir Ulick's the kind jantleman that understands the law for the poor, and
      could bring them off at every turn, and show them the way through the
      holes in an act of parliament, asy as through a <i>riddle</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, and if he could but afford to be half as good as his promises, Sir
      Ulick O'Shane would be too good entirely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Sir Ulick O'Shane had purchased a tract of ground adjoining to Sir
      Herbert's, on this coast; and he had bought it on the speculation that he
      could let it at a very high rent to these people, of whose <i>ways and
      means</i> of paying it he chose to remain in ignorance. All the tenants
      whom Sir Herbert <i>banished</i> from his estate flocked to Sir Ulick's.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the sacrifice of his own immediate interest, and by great personal
      exertion, strict justice, and a generous and well secured system of
      reward, Sir Herbert already had produced a considerable change for the
      better in the morals and habits of the people. He was employing some of
      his tenants on the coast, in building a lighthouse, for which he had a
      grant from parliament; and he was endeavouring to establish a manufacture
      of sail-cloth, for which there was sufficient demand. But almost at every
      step of his progress, he was impeded by the effects of the bad example of
      his neighbours on Sir Ulick's estate; and by the continual quarrels
      between the idle, discarded tenants, and their industrious and now
      prosperous successors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a vessel in distress was seen off the coast, there was a constant
      struggle between the two parties who had opposite interests; the one to
      save, the other to destroy. In this state of things, causes of complaint
      perpetually occurred; and Ormond who was present, when the accusers and
      the accused appealed to their landlord, sometimes as lord of the manor,
      sometimes as magistrate, had frequent opportunities of seeing both Sir
      Herbert's principles and temper put to the test. He liked to compare the
      different modes in which King Corny, his guardian, and Sir Herbert Annaly
      managed these things. Sir Herbert governed neither by threats,
      punishments, abuse, nor tyranny; nor yet did he govern by promises nor
      bribery, <i>favour</i> and <i>protection</i>, like Sir Ulick. He neither
      cajoled nor bullied&mdash;neither held it as a principle, as Marcus did,
      that the people must be kept down, or that the people must be deceived. He
      treated them neither as slaves, subject to his will; nor as dupes, or
      objects on which to exercise his wit or his cunning. He treated them as
      reasonable beings, and as his fellow-creatures, whom he wished to improve,
      that he might make them and himself happy. He spoke sense to them; and he
      mixed that sense with wit and humour, in the proportion necessary to make
      it palatable to an Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In generosity there was a resemblance between the temper of Sir Herbert
      and of Corny; but to Ormond's surprise, and at first to his
      disappointment, Sir Herbert valued justice more than generosity. Ormond's
      heart on this point was often with King Corny, when his head was forced to
      be with Sir Herbert; but, by degrees, head and heart came together. He
      became practically convinced that justice is the virtue that works best
      for a constancy, and best serves every body's interest in time and in
      turn. Ormond now often said to himself, "Sir Herbert Annaly is but a few
      years older than I am; by the time I am of his age, why should not I
      become as useful, and make as many human beings happy as he does?" In the
      meantime, the idea of marrying and settling in Ireland became every day
      more agreeable to Ormond; and France and Italy, which he had been so eager
      to visit, faded from his imagination. Sir Herbert and Lady Annaly, who had
      understood from Dr. Cambray that Ormond was going to commence his grand
      tour immediately, and who heard him make a number of preparatory inquiries
      when he had been first at Annaly, naturally turned the conversation often
      to the subject. They had looked out maps and prints, and they had taken
      down from their shelves the different books of travels, which might be
      most useful to him, with guides, and post-road books, and all that could
      speed the parting guest. But the guest had no mind to part&mdash;every
      thing, every body at Annaly, he found so agreeable and so excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be a great satisfaction to a young man who has a grain of sense,
      and who feels that he is falling inevitably and desperately in love, to
      see that all the lady's family, as well as the object of his passion, are
      exactly the people whom he should wish of all others to make his friends
      for life. Here was every thing that could be desired, suitability of age,
      of fortune, of character, of temper, of tastes&mdash;every thing that
      could make a marriage happy, could Ormond but win the heart of Florence
      Annaly. Was that heart disengaged?&mdash;He resolved to inquire first from
      his dear friend, Dr. Cambray, who was much in the confidence of this
      family, a great favourite with Florence, and consequently dearer than ever
      to Ormond. He went directly to Vicar's Dale to see and consult him, and
      Ormond thought he was confiding a profound secret to the doctor, when
      first he spoke to him of his passion for Miss Annaly; but to his surprise,
      the doctor told him he had seen it long ago, and his wife and daughters
      had all discovered it, even when they were first with him at Annaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible?&mdash;and what do you all think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We think that you would be a perfectly happy man, if you could win Miss
      Annaly; and we wish you success most sincerely. But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>But</i>&mdash;Oh, my dear doctor, you alarm me beyond measure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! by wishing you success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but by something in your look and manner, and by that terrible <i>but</i>:
      you think that I shall never succeed&mdash;you think that her heart is
      engaged. If that be the case, tell me so at once, and I will set off for
      France to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good sir, you are always for desperate measures&mdash;you are in too
      great a hurry to come to a conclusion, before you have the means of
      forming a just conclusion. Remember, I tell you, this precipitate temper
      will some time or other bring some great evil upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will be patient all my life afterwards, if you will only this instant
      tell me whether she is engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know whether Miss Annaly's heart be disengaged or not&mdash;I
      can tell you only that she has had a number of brilliant offers, and that
      she has refused them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That proves that she had not found one amongst them that She liked," said
      Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or that she liked some one better than all those whom she refused," said
      Dr. Cambray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true&mdash;that is possible&mdash;that is a dreadful
      possibility," said Ormond. "But do you think there is any probability of
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is, I am sorry to tell you, my dear Ormond, a probability against
      you&mdash;but I can only state the facts in general. I can form no
      opinion, for I have had no opportunity of judging&mdash;I have never seen
      the two young people together. But there is a gentleman of great merit, of
      suitable family and fortune, who is deeply in love with Miss Annaly, and
      who I presume has not been refused, for I understand he is soon to be
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be here!" cried Ormond: "a man of great merit!&mdash;I hope he is not
      an agreeable man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a vain hope," said Dr. Cambray; "he is a very agreeable man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Very</i> agreeable!&mdash;What sort of person&mdash;grave or gay?&mdash;Like
      any body that I ever saw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, like a person that you have seen, and a person for whom I believe
      you have a regard&mdash;like his own father, your dear King Corny's
      friend, General Albemarle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How extraordinary!&mdash;how unlucky!" said Ormond. "I would rather my
      rival were any one else than the son of a man I am obliged to; and a most
      dangerous rival he must be, if he have his father's merit, and his
      father's manners. Oh! my dear Dr. Cambray, I am sure she likes him&mdash;and
      yet she could not be so cheerful in his absence, if she were much in love&mdash;I
      defy her; and it is impossible that he can be as much in love with her as
      I am, else nothing could keep him from her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but his duty, I suppose you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duty!&mdash;What duty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there really are duties in this world to be performed, though a man
      in love is apt to forget it. Colonel Albemarle, being an officer, cannot
      quit his regiment till he has obtained leave of absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am heartily glad of it," cried Ormond&mdash;"I will make the best use
      of my time before he comes. But, my dear doctor, do you think Lady Annaly&mdash;do
      you think Sir Herbert wish it to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really cannot tell:&mdash;I know only that he is a particular friend of
      Sir Herbert, and that I have heard Lady Annaly speak of him as being a
      young man of excellent character and high honour, for whom she has a great
      regard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forgive me that sigh!" said he: "I thought I never should be
      brought so low as to sigh at bearing of any man's excellent character and
      high honour: but I certainly wish Colonel Albemarle had never been born.
      Heaven preserve me from envy and jealousy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young hero had need to repeat this prayer the next morning at
      breakfast, when Sir Herbert, on opening his letters, exclaimed, "My
      friend, Colonel Albemarle&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lady Annaly, in a tone of joy, "Colonel Albemarle!&mdash;I hope he
      will soon be here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert proceeded: "Cannot obtain leave of absence yet&mdash;but lives
      <i>in hopes</i>," said Sir Herbert, reading the letter, and handing it to
      his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond did not dare, did not think it honourable, to make use of his eyes,
      though there now might have been a decisive moment for observation. No
      sound reached his ear from Miss Annaly's voice; but Lady Annaly spoke
      freely and decidedly in praise of Colonel Albemarle. As she read the
      letter, Sir Herbert, after asking Ormond three times whether he was not
      acquainted with General Albemarle, obtained for answer, that he "really
      did not know." In truth, Ormond did not know any thing at that moment. Sir
      Herbert, surprised, and imagining that Ormond had not yet heard him, was
      going to repeat his question&mdash;but a look from his mother stopped him.
      A sudden light struck Lady Annaly. Mothers are remarkably quick-sighted
      upon these occasions. There was a silence of a few minutes, which appeared
      to poor Ormond to be a silence that would never be broken; it was broken
      by some slight observation which the brother and sister made to each other
      upon a paragraph in the newspaper, which they were reading together.
      Ormond took breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She cannot love him, or she could not be thinking of a paragraph in the
      newspaper at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time forward Ormond was in a continual state of agitation,
      reasoning, as the passions reason, as ill as possible, upon even the
      slightest circumstances that occurred, from whence he might draw
      favourable or unfavourable omens. He was resolved&mdash;and that was
      prudent&mdash;not to speak of his own sentiments, till he was clear how
      matters stood about Colonel Albemarle: he was determined not to expose
      himself to the useless mortification of a refusal. While in this agony of
      uncertainty, he went out one morning to take a solitary walk, that he
      might reflect at leisure. Just as he was turning from the avenue to the
      path that led to the wood, a car full of morning visitors appeared. Ormond
      endeavoured to avoid them, but not before he had been seen. A servant rode
      after him to beg to know "if he were Mr. Harry Ormond&mdash;if he were,
      one of the ladies on the car, Mrs. M'Crule, sent her compliments to him,
      and requested he would be so good as to let her speak with him at the
      house, as she had a few words of consequence to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. M'Crule!" Ormond did not immediately recollect that he had the
      honour of knowing any such person, till the servant said, "Miss Black,
      sir, that was&mdash;formerly at Castle Hermitage."
    </p>
    <p>
      His old enemy, Miss Black, he recollected well. He obeyed the lady's
      summons, and returned to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule had not altered in disposition, though her objects had been
      changed by marriage. Having no longer Lady O'Shane's quarrels with her
      husband to talk about, she had become the pest of the village of Castle
      Hermitage and of the neighbourhood&mdash;the Lady Bluemantle of the
      parish. Had Miss Black remained in England, married or single, she would
      only have been one of a numerous species too well known to need any
      description; but transplanted to a new soil and a new situation, she
      proved to be a variety of the old species, with peculiarly noxious
      qualities, which it may be useful to describe, as a warning to the unwary.
      It is unknown how much mischief the Lady Bluemantle class may do in
      Ireland, where parties in religion and politics run high; and where it
      often happens, that individuals of the different sects and parties
      actually hate without knowing each other, watch without mixing with one
      another, and consequently are prone reciprocally to believe any stories or
      reports, however false or absurd, which tend to gratify their antipathies.
      In this situation it is scarcely possible to get the exact truth as to the
      words, actions, and intentions, of the nearest neighbours, who happen to
      be of opposite parties or persuasions. What a fine field is here for a
      mischief-maker! Mrs. M'Crule had in her parish done her part; she had gone
      from rich to poor, from poor to rich, from catholic to protestant, from
      churchman to dissenter, and from dissenter to methodist, reporting every
      idle story, and repeating every ill-natured thing that she heard said&mdash;things
      often more bitterly expressed than thought, and always exaggerated or
      distorted in the repetition. No two people in the parish could have
      continued on speaking terms at the end of the year, but that, happily,
      there were in this parish both a good clergyman and a good priest; and
      still more happily, they both agreed in labouring for the good of their
      parishioners. Dr. Cambray and Mr. M'Cormuck made it their business
      continually to follow after Mrs. M'Crule, healing the wounds which she
      inflicted, and pouring into the festering heart the balm of Christian
      charity: they were beloved and revered by their parishioners; Mrs. M'Crule
      was soon detected, and universally avoided. Enraged, she attacked, by
      turns, both the clergyman and the priest; and when she could not separate
      them, she found out that it was very wrong that they should agree. She
      discovered that she was a much better protestant, and a much better
      Christian, than Dr. Cambray, because she hated her catholic neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cambray had taken pains to secure the co-operation of the catholic
      clergyman, in all his attempts to improve the lower classes of the people.
      His village school was open to catholics as well as protestants; and
      Father M'Cormuck, having been assured that their religion would not be
      tampered with, allowed and encouraged his flock to send their children to
      the same seminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule was, or affected to be, much alarmed and scandalized at
      seeing catholic and protestant children mixing so much together; she knew
      that opinions were divided among some families in the neighbourhood upon
      the propriety of this <i>mixture</i>, and Mrs. M'Crule thought it a fine
      opportunity of making herself of consequence, by stirring up the matter
      into a party question. This bright idea had occurred to her just about the
      time that Ormond brought over little Tommy from the Black Islands. During
      Ormond's absence upon his tour, Sheelah and Moriarty had regularly sent
      the boy to the village school; exhorting him to mind his <i>book</i> and
      his <i>figures</i>, that he might surprise Mr. Ormond with his <i>larning</i>
      when he should come back. Tommy, with this excitation, and being a quick,
      clever little fellow, soon got to the head of his class, and kept there;
      and won all the school-prizes, and carried them home in triumph to his
      grandame, and to his dear Moriarty, to be treasured up, that he might show
      them to Mr. Ormond at his return home. Dr. Cambray was pleased with the
      boy, and so was every body, except Mrs. M'Crule. She often visited the
      school for the pleasure of finding fault; and she <i>wondered</i> to see
      this little Tommy, who was a catholic, carrying away the prizes from all
      the others. She thought it her duty to inquire farther about him; and as
      soon as she discovered that he came from the Black Islands, that he lived
      with Moriarty, and that Mr. Ormond was interested about him, she said she
      knew there was something wrong&mdash;therefore, she set her face against
      the child, and against the shameful partiality that <i>some people</i>
      showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cambray pursued his course without attending to her; and little Tommy
      pursued his course, improving rapidly in his <i>larning</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was in that county an excellent charitable institution for the
      education of children from seven to twelve years old; an apprentice fee
      was given with the children when they left the school, and they had
      several other advantages, which made parents of the lower classes
      extremely desirous to get their sons into this establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they could be admitted, it was necessary that they should have a
      certificate from their parish minister and catholic clergyman, stating
      that they could read and write, and that they were well-behaved children.
      On a certain day, every year, a number of candidates were presented. The
      certificates from the clergyman and priest of their respective parishes
      were much attended to by the lady patronesses, and by these the choice of
      the candidate to be admitted was usually decided. Little Tommy had an
      excellent certificate both from Father M'Cormuck and from Dr. Cambray.
      Sheelah and Moriarty were in great joy, and had "all the hopes in life"
      for him; and Sheelah, who was very fond of <i>surprises</i>, had cautioned
      Moriarty, and begged the doctor not to tell Mr. Harry a word about it, <i>till
      all was fixed</i>, "for if the boy should not have the luck to be chose at
      last, it would only be breaking his little heart the worse, that Mr. Harry
      should know any thing at all about it, sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Mrs. M'Crule was working against little Tommy with all her
      might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the lady patronesses were of opinion, that it would be expedient
      in future, to confine their bounty to the children of protestants only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule, who had been deputed by one of the absent ladies to act for
      her, was amazingly busy, visiting all the patronesses, and talking, and
      fearing, and "hoping to heaven!" and prophesying, canvassing, and
      collecting opinions and votes, as for a matter of life and death. She
      hinted that she knew that the greatest interest was making to get in this
      year a catholic child, and there was no knowing, if this went on, what the
      consequence might be. In short Ireland would be ruined, if little Tommy
      should prove the successful candidate. Mrs. M'Crule did not find it
      difficult to stir up the prejudices and passions of several ladies, whose
      education and whose means of information might have secured them from such
      contemptible influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her present business at Annaly was to try what impression she could make
      on Lady and Miss Annaly, who were both patronesses of the school. As to
      Ormond, whom she never had liked, she was glad of this opportunity of
      revenging herself upon his little protg; and of making Mr. Ormond
      sensible, that she was now a person of rather more consequence than she
      had been, when he used formerly to defy her at Castle Hermitage. She
      little thought that, while she was thus pursuing the dictates of her own
      hate, she might serve the interests of Ormond's love.

      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Ormond returned, in obedience to Mrs. M'Crule's summons, he found in
      the room an unusual assemblage of persons&mdash;a party of morning
      visitors, the unmuffled contents of the car. As he entered, he bowed as
      courteously as possible to the whole circle, and advanced towards Mrs.
      M'Crule, whose portentous visage he could not fail to recognize. That
      visage was nearly half a yard long, thin out of all proportion, and dismal
      beyond all imagination; the corners of the mouth drawn down, the whites or
      yellows of the eyes upturned, while with hands outspread she was
      declaiming, and in a lamentable tone deploring, as Ormond thought, some
      great public calamity; for the concluding words were "The danger, my dear
      Lady Annaly&mdash;the danger, my dear Miss Annaly&mdash;oh! the danger is
      imminent. We shall all be positively undone, ma'am; and Ireland&mdash;oh!
      I wish I was once safe in England again&mdash;Ireland positively will be
      ruined!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, looking to Lady Annaly and Miss Annaly for explanation, was
      somewhat re-assured in this imminent danger, by seeing that Lady Annaly's
      countenance was perfectly tranquil, and that a slight smile played on the
      lips of Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ormond," said Lady Annaly, "I am sorry to hear that Ireland is in
      danger of being ruined by your means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my means!" said Ormond, in great surprise; "I beg your ladyship's
      pardon for repeating your words, but I really cannot understand them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I neither; but by the time you have lived as long as I have in the
      world," said Lady Annaly, "you will not be so much surprised as you now
      seem, my good sir, at hearing people say what you do not understand. I am
      told that Ireland will be undone by means of a <i>protg</i> of yours, of
      the name of Tommy Dun&mdash;not Dun Scotus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dunshaughlin, perhaps," said Ormond, laughing, "Tommy Dunshaughlin! <i>that</i>
      little urchin! What harm can little Tommy do to Ireland, or to any
      mortal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without condescending to turn her eyes upon Ormond, whose propensity to
      laughter had of old been offensive to her nature, Mrs. M'Crule continued
      to Lady Annaly, "It is not of this insignificant child as an individual
      that I am speaking, Lady Annaly; but your ladyship, who has lived so long
      in the world, must know that there is no person or thing, however
      insignificant, that cannot, in the hands of a certain description of
      people, be made an engine of mischief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true, indeed," said Lady Annaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is no telling or conceiving," pursued Mrs. M'Crule, "how in the
      hands of a certain party, you know, ma'am, any thing now, even the leas
      and the most innocent child (not that I take upon me to say that this
      child is so very innocent, though, to be sure, he is very little)&mdash;but
      innocent or not, there is positively nothing, Lady Annaly, ma'am, which a
      certain party, certain evil-disposed persons, cannot turn to their
      purposes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot contradict that&mdash;I wish I could," said Lady Annaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I see your ladyship and Miss Annaly do not consider this matter as
      seriously as I could wish. 'Tis an infatuation," said Mrs. M'Crule,
      uttering a sigh, almost a groan, for her ladyship's and her daughter's
      infatuation. "But if people, ladies especially, knew but half as much as I
      have learnt, since I married Mr. M'Crule, of the real state of Ireland; or
      if they had but half a quarter as many means as I have of obtaining
      information, Mr. M'Crule being one of his majesty's very active justices
      of the peace, riding about, and up and down, ma'am, scouring the country,
      sir, you know, and having informers, high and low, bringing us every sort
      of intelligence; I say, my dear Lady Annaly, ma'am, you would, if you only
      heard a hundredth part of what I hear daily, tremble&mdash;your ladyship
      would tremble from morning till night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am heartily glad I do not hear it; for I should dislike very much
      to tremble from morning till night, especially as my trembling could do
      nobody any good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Lady Annaly, ma'am, you <i>can</i> do good by exerting yourself to
      prevent the danger in this emergency; you <i>can</i> do good, and it
      becomes your station and your character; you <i>can</i> do good, my dear
      Lady Annaly, ma'am, to thousands in existence, and thousands yet unborn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My benevolence having but a limited appetite for thousands," said Lady
      Annaly, "I should rather, if it be equal to you, Mrs. M'Crule, begin with
      the thousands already in existence; and of those thousands, why not begin
      with little Tommy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no use!" cried Mrs. M'Crule, rising from her seat in the
      indignation of disappointed zeal: "Jenny, pull the bell for the car&mdash;Mrs.
      M'Greggor, if you've no objection, I'm at your service, for 'tis no use I
      see for me to speak here&mdash;nor should I have done so, but that I
      positively thought it my duty; and also a becoming attention to your
      ladyship and Miss Annaly, as lady patronesses, to let you know beforehand
      <i>our</i> sentiments, as I have collected the opinions of so many of the
      leading ladies, and apprehended your ladyship might, before it came to a
      public push, like to have an inkling or inuendo of how matters are likely
      to be carried at the general meeting of the patronesses on Saturday next,
      when we are determined to put it to the vote and poll. Jenny, do you see
      Jack, and the car? Good morning to your ladyship; good day, Miss Annaly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond put in a detainer: "I am here in obedience to your summons, Mrs.
      M'Crule&mdash;you sent to inform me that you had a few words of
      consequence to say to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, sir, I did wrap myself up this winter morning, and came out, as
      Mrs. M'Greggor can testify, in spite of my poor face, in hopes of doing
      some little good, and giving a friendly hint, before an explosion should
      publicly take place. But you will excuse me, since I find I gain so little
      credit, and so waste my breath; I can only leave gentlemen and ladies in
      this emergency, if they will be blind to the danger at this crisis, to
      follow their own opinions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond still remonstrating on the cruelty of leaving him in utter
      darkness, and calling it blindness, and assuring Mrs. M'Crule that he had
      not the slightest conception of what the danger or the emergency to which
      she alluded might be, or what little Tommy could have to do with it, the
      lady condescended, in compliance with Mrs. M'Greggor's twitch behind, to
      stay and recommence her statement. He could not forbear smiling, even more
      than Lady Annaly had done, when he was made to understand that the <i>emergency</i>
      and <i>crisis</i> meant nothing but this child's being admitted or not
      admitted into a charity school. While Ormond was incapable of speaking in
      reply with becoming seriousness, Florence, who saw his condition, had the
      kindness to draw off Mrs. M'Crule's attention, by asking her to partake of
      some excellent goose-pie, which just then made its entrance. This
      promised, for a time, to suspend the discussion, and to unite all parties
      in one common sympathy. When Florence saw that the <i>consomm</i>, to
      which she delicately helped her, was not thrown away upon Mrs. M'Crule,
      and that the union of goose and turkey in this Christmas dainty was much
      admired by this good lady, she attempted playfully to pass to a reflection
      on the happy effect that might to some tastes result from unions in party
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no&mdash;"too serious matters these to be jested with," even with a
      glass of Barsac at the lips. Mrs. M'Crule stopped to say so, and to sigh.
      Per favour of the Barsac, however, Florence ventured to try what a little
      raillery might do. It was possible, that, if Mrs. M'Greggor and the chorus
      of young ladies could be made to laugh, Mrs. M'Crule might be brought to
      see the whole thing in a less gloomy point of view; and might perhaps be,
      just in time, made sensible of the ridicule to which she would expose
      herself, by persisting in sounding so pompously a false alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can there really be so much danger," said Florence, "in letting
      little children, protestant and catholic, come together to the same school&mdash;sit
      on the same bench&mdash;learn the same alphabet from the same hornbook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear Miss Annaly," cried Mrs. M'Crule, "I do wonder to hear you
      treat this matter so lightly&mdash;you, from whom I confess I did expect
      better principles: 'sit on the same bench!' easily said; but, my dear
      young lady, you do not consider that some errors of popery,&mdash;since
      there is no catholic in the room, I suppose I may say it,&mdash;the errors
      of popery are wonderfully infectious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember," said Lady Annaly, "when I was a child, being present once,
      when an <i>honest man</i>, that is, a protestant (for in those days no man
      but a protestant could be called an <i>honest man</i>), came to my uncle
      in a great passion to complain of the priest: 'My lord,' said he, 'what do
      you think the priest is going to do? he is going to bury a catholic
      corpse, not only in the churchyard, but, my lord, near to the grave of my
      father, who died a stanch dissenter.' 'My dear sir,' said my uncle, to the
      angry <i>honest man</i>, 'the clergyman of the parish is using me worse
      still, for he is going to bury a man, who died last Wednesday of the
      small-pox, near to my grandmother, who never had the small-pox in her
      life.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule pursed up her mouth very close at this story. She thought
      Lady Annaly and her uncle were equally wicked, but she did not choose
      exactly to say so, as her ladyship's uncle was a person of rank, and of
      character too solidly established for Mrs. M'Crule to shake. She therefore
      only gave one of her sighs for the sins of the whole generation, and after
      a recording look at Mrs. M'Greggor, she returned to the charge about the
      schools and the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can do no possible good," she said, "to admit catholic children to <i>our</i>
      schools, because, do what you will, you can never make them good
      protestants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Lady Annaly, "as my friend, the excellent Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;
      said in parliament, 'if you cannot make them good protestants, make them
      good catholics, make them good any-things.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Giving up Lady Annaly all together, Mrs. M'Crule now desired to have Mr.
      Ormond's ultimatum&mdash;she wished to know whether he had made up his
      mind as to the affair in question; but she begged leave to observe, "that
      since the child had, to use the gentlest expression, the <i>misfortune</i>
      to be born and bred a catholic, it would be most prudent and gentlemanlike
      in Mr. Ormond not to make him a bone of contention, but to withdraw the
      poor child from the contest altogether, and strike his name out of the
      list of candidates, till the general question of admittance to those of
      his persuasion should have been decided by the lady patronesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond declared, with or without submission to Mrs. M'Crule, that he could
      not think it becoming or gentlemanlike to desert a child whom he had
      undertaken to befriend&mdash;that, whatever the child had the misfortune
      to be born, he would abide by him; and would not add to his misfortunes by
      depriving him of the reward of his own industry and application, and of
      the only chance he had of continuing his good education, and of getting
      forward in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule sighed and groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ormond persisted: "The child," he said, "should have fair play&mdash;the
      lady patronesses would decide as they thought proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been said that the boy had Dr. Cambray's certificate, which Ormond
      was certain would not have been given undeservedly; he had also the
      certificate of his own priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! what signifies the certificate of his priest," interrupted Mrs.
      M'Crule; "and as for Dr. Cambray's, though he is a most respectable man
      (too liberal, perhaps), yet without meaning to insinuate any thing
      derogatory&mdash;but we all know how things are managed, and Dr. Cambray's
      great regard for Mr. Ormond might naturally influence him a little in
      favour of this little protg."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence was very busy in replenishing Mrs. M'Greggor's plate, and Ormond
      haughtily told Mrs. M'Crule, "that as to Dr. Cambray's character for
      impartiality, he should leave that securely to speak for itself; and that
      as to the rest, she was at liberty to say or hint whatever she pleased, as
      far as he was concerned; but that, for her own sake, he would recommend it
      to her to be sure of her facts&mdash;for that slander was apt to hurt in
      the recoil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed by the tone of confident innocence and determination with which
      Ormond spoke, Mrs. M'Crule, who like all other bullies was a coward,
      lowered her voice, and protested she meant nothing&mdash;"certainly no
      offence to Mr. Ormond; and as to slander there was nothing she detested so
      much&mdash;she was quite glad to be set right&mdash;for people did talk&mdash;and
      she had endeavoured to silence them, and now could from the best
      authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond looked as if he wished that any authority could silence her&mdash;but
      no hopes of that. "She was sorry to find, however, that Mr. Ormond was
      positively determined to encourage the boy, whoever he was, to persist as
      candidate on this occasion, because she should be concerned to do any
      thing that looked like opposing him; yet she must, and she knew others
      were determined, and in short, he would be mortified to no purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," Ormond said, "he could only do his best, and bear to be mortified,
      if necessary, or when necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile of approbation from Florence made his heart beat, and for some
      moments Mrs. M'Crule spoke without his knowing one syllable she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule saw the smile, and perceived the effect. As she rose to
      depart, she turned to Miss Annaly, and whispered, but loud enough for all
      to hear, "Miss Annaly must excuse me if I warn her, that if she takes the
      part I am inclined to fear she will on Saturday, people I know <i>will</i>
      draw inferences."
    </p>
    <p>
      Florence coloured, but with calm dignity and spirit, which Mrs. M'Crule
      did not expect from her usual gentleness and softness of manners, she
      replied, that "no inference which might be drawn from her conduct by any
      persons should prevent her from acting as she thought right, and taking
      that part which she believed to be just."
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the visit, or the visitation. The next day Lady Annaly, Miss
      Annaly, Sir Herbert, and Ormond, went to Vicar's Dale, and thence with the
      good doctor to the village school, on purpose that they might see and form
      an impartial judgment of the little boy. On one day in the week, the
      parents and friends of the children were admitted if they chose it, to the
      school-room, to hear the lessons, and to witness the adjudging of the
      week's premiums. This was <i>prize day</i> as they called it, and Sheelah
      and Moriarty were among the spectators. Their presence, and the presence
      of Mr. Ormond, so excited&mdash;so over-excited Tommy, that when he first
      stood up to read, his face flushed, his voice faltered, his little hands
      trembled so much that he could hardly hold the book; he could by no means
      turn over the leaf, and he was upon the point of disgracing himself by
      bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! ho!" cried an ill-natured voice of triumph from one of the
      spectators. Ormond and the Annalys turned, and saw behind them Mrs.
      M'Crule.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder!" whispered Sheelah to Moriarty, "if she fixes him with that <i>evil
      eye</i>, and he gets the stroke of it, Moriarty, 'tis all over with him
      for life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, woman, dear&mdash;what can hurt him? is not the good doctor in
      person standing betwixt him and harm? and see! he is recovering upon it
      fast&mdash;quite come to!&mdash;Hark!&mdash;he is himself again&mdash;Tommy,
      voice and all!&mdash;success to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had success, and he deserved it&mdash;the prizes were his; and when
      they were given to him, the congratulating smiles of his companions showed
      that Dr. Cambray's justice was unimpeached by those whom it most
      concerned; that notwithstanding all that had been said and done directly
      and indirectly, to counteract his benevolent efforts, he had succeeded in
      preventing envy and party-spirit from spreading discord among these
      innocent children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Crule withdrew, and nobody saw when or how.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is clear," said Lady Annaly, "that this boy is no favourite, for he
      has friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, if he be a favourite, and have friends, it is a proof that he has
      extraordinary merit," said Sir Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is coming to us," said Florence, who had been excessively interested
      for the child, and whose eyes had followed him wherever he went:
      "Brother," whispered she, "will you let him pass you? he wants to say
      something to Mr. Ormond."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy brought to Ormond all the prizes which he had won since the time
      he first came to school: his grandame, Sheelah, had kept them safe in a
      little basket, which he now put into Ormond's hands, with honest pride and
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got 'em, and Granny said you'd like to see them, so she did&mdash;and
      here's what will please you&mdash;see my certificates&mdash;see, signed by
      the doctor himself's own hand, and Father M'Cormuck, that's his name, with
      his blessing by the same token he gave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond looked with great satisfaction on Tommy's treasures, and Miss
      Annaly looked at them too with no small delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my boy, have you any thing more to say?" said Ormond to the child,
      who looked as if he was anxious to say something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, sir; it's what I'd be glad to speak a word with you, Mr. Harry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak it then&mdash;you are not afraid of this lady?" "Oh, no&mdash;that
      I am not," said the boy, with a very expressive smile and emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the child seemed to wish that no one else should hear, Ormond
      retired a step or two with him behind the crowd. Tommy would not let go
      Miss Annaly's hand, so she heard all that passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afeard I am too troublesome to you, sir," said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me&mdash;not the least," said Ormond: "speak on&mdash;say all you have
      in your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then," said the child, "I <i>have</i> something greatly on my mind,
      because I heard Granny talking to Moriarty about it last night, over the
      fire, and I in the bed. Then I know all about Mrs. M'Crule, and how, if I
      don't give out, and wouldn't give up about the grand school, on Saturday,
      I should, may be, be bringing you, Mr. Harry, into great trouble: so that
      being the case, I'll give up entirely&mdash;and I'll go back to the Black
      Islands to-morrow," said Tommy, stoutly; yet swelling so in the chest that
      he could not say another word. He turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were walking home together from the school, Moriarty said to
      Sheelah, "I'll engage, Sheelah, you did not see all that passed the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll engage I did, though," said Sheelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, Sheelah, you've quick eyes still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I'm not so blind but what I could see <i>that</i> with half an eye&mdash;ay,
      and saw how it was with them before you did, Moriarty. From the first
      minute they comed into the room together, said I to myself, 'there's a
      pair of angels well matched, if ever there was a pair on earth.' These
      things is all laid out above, unknownst to us, from the first minute we
      are born, <i>who</i> we are to have in marriage," added Sheelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not <i>fixed</i> from the first minute we are born, Sheelah: it is <i>not</i>,"
      said Moriarty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how should you know, Moriarty," said Sheelah, "whether or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not as well as you, Sheelah, dear," replied Moriarty, "if you go
      to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, in the name of fortune, have it your own way," said Sheelah; "and
      how do you think it is then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why it is partly fixed for us," said Moriarty; "but the choice is still
      in us, always&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! burn me if I understand that," said Sheelah.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are mighty hard of understanding this morning, Sheelah. See,
      now, with regard to Master Harry and Peggy Sheridan: it's my opinion,
      'twas laid out from the first, that in case he did not do <i>that</i>
      wrong about Peggy&mdash;<i>then</i> see, Heaven had this lady, this angel,
      from that time forward in view for him, by way of <i>compensation</i> for
      not doing the wrong he might have chose to do. Now, don't you think,
      Sheelah, that's the way it was?&mdash;be a rasonable woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rasonable woman was puzzled and silent, Sheelah and Moriarty having
      got, without knowing it, to the dark depths of metaphysics. There was some
      danger of their knocking their heads against each other there, as wiser
      heads have done on similar occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an auspicious circumstance for Ormond's love that Florence had now
      a daily object of thought and feeling in common with him. Mrs. M'Crule's
      having piqued Florence was in Ormond's favour: it awakened her pride, and
      conquered her timidity; she ventured to trust her own motives. To be sure,
      the interest she felt for this child was uncommonly vivid; but she might
      safely avow this interest&mdash;it was in the cause of one who was
      innocent, and who had been oppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. M'Crule was so vindictively busy, going about, daily, among the
      lady patronesses, preparing for the great battle that was to be decided on
      the famous Saturday, it was necessary that Lady and Miss Annaly should
      exert themselves at least to make the truth known to their friends, to
      take them to see Dr. Cambray's school, and to judge of the little
      candidate impartially. The day for decision came, and Florence felt an
      anxiety, an eagerness, which made her infinitely more amiable, and more
      interesting in Ormond's eyes. The election was decided in favour of
      humanity and justice. Florence was deputed to tell the decision to the
      successful little candidate, who was waiting, with his companions, to hear
      his fate. Radiant with benevolent pleasure, she went to announce the glad
      tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if she is not beautiful!" cried Sheelah, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond felt it so warmly, and his looks expressed his feelings so
      strongly, that Florence, suddenly abashed, could scarcely finish her
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. M'Crule had been present, she might again have cried "Oh! ho!" but
      she had retreated, too much discomfited, by the disappointments of hatred,
      to stay even to embarrass the progress of love. Love had made of late
      rapid progress. Joining in the cause of justice and humanity, mixing with
      all the virtues, he had taken possession of the heart happily, safely&mdash;unconsciously
      at first, yet triumphantly at last. Where was Colonel Albemarle all this
      time? Ormond neither knew nor cared; he thought but little of him at this
      moment. However, said he to himself, Colonel Albemarle will be here in a
      few days&mdash;it is better for me to see how things are there, before I
      speak&mdash;I am sure Florence could not give me a decisive answer, till
      her brother has disentangled that business for her. Lady Annaly said as
      much to me the other day, if I understood her rightly&mdash;and I am sure
      this is the state of the case, from the pains Florence takes now to avoid
      giving me an opportunity of speaking to her alone, which I have been
      watching for so anxiously. So reasoned Ormond; but his reasonings, whether
      wise or foolish, were set at nought by unforeseen events.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening Ormond walked with Sir Herbert Annaly to the sea-shore, to
      look at the lighthouse which was building. He was struck with all that had
      been done here in the course of a few months, and especially with the
      alteration in the appearance of the people. Their countenances had changed
      from the look of desponding idleness and cunning, to the air of busy,
      hopeful independence. He could not help congratulating Sir Herbert, and
      warmly expressing a wish that he might himself, in the whole course of his
      life, do half as much good as Sir Herbert had already effected. "You will
      do a great deal more," said Sir Herbert: "you will have a great deal more
      time. I must make the best of the little&mdash;probably the very little
      time I shall have: while I yet live, let me not live in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Yet</i> live," said Ormond; "I hope&mdash;I trust&mdash;you will live
      many years to be happy, and to make others so: your strength seems quite
      re-established&mdash;you have all the appearance of health."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert smiled, but shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Ormond, do not trust to outward appearances too much. Do not let
      my friends entirely deceive themselves. I <i>know</i> that my life cannot
      be long&mdash;I wish, before I die, to do as much good as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which these words were said, and the look with which they
      were accompanied, impressed Ormond at once with a conviction of the
      danger, fortitude, and magnanimity of the person who spoke to him. The
      hectic colour, the brilliant eye, the vividness of fancy, the superiority
      of intellectual powers, the warmth of the affections, and the amiable
      gentleness of the disposition of this young man, were, alas! but so many
      fatal indications of his disease. The energy with which, with decreasing
      bodily and increasing mental strength, he pursued his daily occupations,
      and performed more than every duty of his station, the never-failing
      temper and spirits with which he sustained the hopes of many of his
      friends, were but so many additional causes of alarm to the too
      experienced mother. Florence, with less experience, and with a temper
      happily prone to hope, was more easily deceived. She could not believe
      that a being, whom she saw so full of life, could be immediately in danger
      of dying. Her brother had now but a very slight cough&mdash;he had, to all
      appearance, recovered from the accident by which they had been so much
      alarmed when they were in England. The physicians had pronounced, that
      with care to avoid cold, and all violent exertion, he might do well and
      last long.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fulfil the conditions was difficult; especially that which required him
      to refrain from any great exertion. Whenever he could be of service to his
      friends, or could do any good to his fellow-creatures, he spared neither
      mental nor bodily exertion. Under the influence of benevolent enthusiasm,
      he continually forgot the precarious tenure by which he held his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the middle of winter, and one stormy night a vessel was wrecked
      on the coast near Annaly. The house was at such a distance from that part
      of the shore where the vessel struck, that Sir Herbert knew nothing of it
      till the next morning, when it was all over. No lives were lost. It was a
      small trading vessel, richly laden. Knowing the vile habits of some of the
      people who lived on the coast, Sir Herbert, the moment he heard that there
      was a wreck, went down to see that the property of the sufferers was
      protected from those depredators, who on such occasions were astonishingly
      alert. Ormond accompanied him, and by their joint exertions much of the
      property was placed in safety under a military guard. Some had been seized
      and carried off before their arrival, but not by any of Sir Herbert's
      tenants. It became pretty clear that <i>the neighbours</i> on Sir Ulick
      O'Shane's estate were the offenders. They had grown bold from impunity,
      and from the belief that no <i>jantleman</i> "would choose to interfere
      with them, on account of their landlord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Herbert's indignation rose. Ormond pledged himself that Sir Ulick
      O'Shane would never protect such wretches; and eager to assist public
      justice, to defend his guardian, and, above all, to calm Sir Herbert and
      prevent him from over-exerting himself, he insisted upon being allowed to
      go in his stead with the party of military who were to search the
      suspected houses. It was with some difficulty that he prevailed. He parted
      with Sir Herbert; and, struck at the moment with his highly-raised colour,
      and the violent heat and state of excitation he was in, Ormond again urged
      him to remember his own health, and his mother and sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will&mdash;I do," said Sir Herbert; "but it is my duty to think of
      public justice before I think of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The apprehension Ormond felt in quitting Sir Herbert recurred frequently
      as he rode on in silence; but he was called into action and it was
      dissipated. Ormond spent nearly three hours searching a number of wretched
      cabins from which the male inhabitants fled at the approach of the
      military, leaving the women and children to make what excuses and tell
      what lies they could. This the women and children executed with great
      readiness and ability, and in the most pity-moving tones imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside of an Irish cabin appears very different to those who come to
      claim hospitality and to those who come to detect offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond having never before entered a cabin with a search-warrant,
      constable, or with the military, he was "not <i>up</i> to the thing"&mdash;as
      both the serjeant and constable remarked to each other. While he listened
      to the piteous story of a woman about a husband who had broken his leg
      from a ladder, <i>sarving</i> the masons at Sir Herbert's lighthouse, and
      was <i>lying at</i> the hospital, <i>not expected</i>, [Footnote: <i>Not
      expected</i> to live.] the husband was lying all the time with both his
      legs safe and sound in a potato furrow within a few yards of the house.
      And <i>the child</i> of another eloquent matron was running off with a
      pair of silver-mounted pistols taken from the wreck, which he was
      instructed to hide in a bog-hole, snug&mdash;the bog-water never rusting.
      In one hovel&mdash;for the houses of these wretches who lived by pillage,
      after all their ill-gotten gains, were no better than hovels&mdash;in one
      of them, in which, as the information stated, some valuable plunder was
      concealed, they found nothing but a poor woman groaning in bed, and two
      little children; one crying as if its heart would break, and the other
      sitting up behind the mother's bolster supporting her. After the soldiers
      had searched every place in vain, even the thatch of the house, the woman
      showing no concern all the while, but groaning on, seeming scarce able to
      answer Mr. Ormond's questions&mdash;the constable, an old hand, roughly
      bid her get up, that they might search the bed; this Ormond would not
      permit:&mdash;she lay still, thanking his honour faintly, and they quitted
      the house. The goods which had been carried off were valuable, and were
      hid in the straw of the very bed on which the woman was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were returning homewards after their fruitless search, when they
      had passed the boundary of Sir Ulick's and had reached Sir Herbert's
      territory, they were overtaken by a man, who whispered something to the
      serjeant which made him halt, and burst out a laughing; the laugh ran
      through the whole serjeant's guard, and reached Ormond's ears; who, asking
      the cause of it, was told how the woman had cheated them, and how she was
      now risen from her bed, and was dividing the prize among the <i>lawful
      owners</i>, "share and share alike." These lawful owners, all risen out of
      the potato furrows, and returning from the bogs, were now assembled,
      holding their bed of justice. At the moment the serjeant's information
      came off, their captain, with a bottle of whiskey in his hand, was
      drinking, "To the health of Sir Ulick O'Shane, our worthy landlord&mdash;seldom
      comes a better. The same to his ward, Harry Ormond, Esq., and may his
      eyesight never be better nor worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Ormond instantly turned his horse's head, much provoked at having
      been duped, and resolved that the plunderers should not now escape. By the
      advice of serjeants and constables, he dismounted, that no sound of
      horses' hoofs might give notice from a distance; though, indeed, on the
      sands of the sea-shore, no horses' tread, he thought, could be heard. He
      looked round for some one with whom he could leave his horse, but not a
      creature, except the men who were with him, was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can have become of all the people?" said Ormond: "it is not the
      workmen's dinner-hour, and they are gone from the work at the lighthouse;
      and the horses and cars are left without any one with them." He went on a
      few paces, and saw a boy who seemed to be left to watch the horses, and
      who looked very melancholy. The boy did not speak as Ormond came up. "What
      is the matter?" said Ormond: "something dreadful has happened&mdash;speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not you hear it, sir?" said the boy: "I'd be loth to tell it you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has any thing happened to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Herbert&mdash;ay&mdash;the worst that could. Running to stop one of
      them villains that was making off with something from the wreck, he
      dropped sudden as if he was shot, and&mdash;when they went to lift him up&mdash;But
      you'll drop yourself, sir," said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him some of the water out of the bucket, can't ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's my cap," said the serjeant. Ormond was made to swallow the water,
      and, recovering his senses, heard one of the soldiers near him say, "'Twas
      only a faint Sir Herbert took, I'll engage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought was new life to Ormond: he started up, mounted his horse, and
      galloped off&mdash;saw no creature on the road&mdash;found a crowd at the
      gate of the avenue&mdash;the crowd opened to let him pass, many voices
      calling as he passed to beg him to <i>send out word</i>. This gave him
      fresh hopes, since nothing certain was known: he spurred on his horse; but
      when he reached the house, as he was going to Sir Herbert's room he was
      met by Sir Herbert's own man, O'Reilly. The moment he saw O'Reilly's face,
      he knew there was no hope&mdash;he asked no question: the surgeon came
      out, and told him that in consequence of having broke a blood-vessel,
      which bled internally, Sir Herbert had just expired&mdash;his mother and
      sister were with him. Ormond retired&mdash;he begged the servants would
      write to him at Dr. Cambray's&mdash;and he immediately went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after he had a note from O'Reilly, written in haste, at a very
      early hour in the morning, to say that he was just setting out with the
      hearse to the family burial-place at Herbert&mdash;it having been thought
      best that the funeral should not be in this neighbourhood, on account of
      the poor people at Annaly being so exasperated against those who were
      thought to be the immediate occasion of his death. Sir Herbert's last
      orders to O'Reilly were to this effect&mdash;"to <i>take care</i>, and to
      have every thing done as privately as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      No pomp of funeral was, indeed, necessary for such a person. The great may
      need it&mdash;the good need it not: they are mourned in the heart, and
      they are remembered without vain pageantry. If public sorrow can soothe
      private grief&mdash;and surely in some measure it must&mdash;the family
      and friends of this young man had this consolation; but they had another
      and a better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the triumph of religion and of its ministers to be able to support
      the human heart, when all other resources are of little avail. Time, it is
      true, at length effaces the recollection of misfortune, and age deadens
      the sense of sorrow. But that power to console is surely far superior in
      its effect, more worthy of a rational and a social being, which operates&mdash;not
      by contracting or benumbing our feelings and faculties, but by expanding
      and ennobling them&mdash;inspiring us, not with stoic indifference to the
      pains and pleasures of humanity, but with pious submission to the will of
      Heaven&mdash;to the order and orderer of the universe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Though Sir Ulick O'Shane contrived to laugh on most occasions where other
      people would have wept, and though he had pretty well <i>case-hardened</i>
      his heart, yet he was shocked by the first news of the death of Sir
      Herbert Annaly. He knew the man must die, he said&mdash;so must we all,
      sooner or later&mdash;but for the manner of his death, Sir Ulick could not
      help feeling a secret pang. He felt conscious of having encouraged, or at
      least connived at, the practices of those wretches who had roused the
      generous and just indignation of Sir Herbert, and in pursuit of whom this
      fine young man had fallen a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only the "still small voice," but the cry of the country, was against
      Sir Ulick on this occasion. He saw that he must give up the offenders, and
      show decidedly that he desired to have them punished. Decidedly, then, and
      easily, as ever prince abandoned secretary or chancellor to save his own
      popularity, quickly as ever grand seignior gave up grand vizier or chief
      baker to appease the people, Sir Ulick gave up his "<i>honest rascals</i>,"
      his "<i>rare rapparees</i>," and even his "<i>wrecker royal</i>." Sir
      Ulick set his magistrate, Mr. M'Crule, at work for once on the side both
      of justice and law; warrants, committals, and constables, cleared the
      land. Many fled&mdash;a few were seized, escorted ostentatiously by <i>a
      serjeant and twelve</i> of Sir Ulick's corps, and lodged in the county
      jail to stand their trial, bereft of all <i>favour and purtection</i>,
      bon fide delivered up to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable tract of Sir Ulick's coast estate, in consequence of this,
      remained untenanted. Some person in whom he could confide must be selected
      to inhabit the fishing-lodge, and to take care of the cabins and land till
      they should be relet. Sir Ulick pitched upon Moriarty Carroll for this
      purpose, and promised him such liberal reward, that all Moriarty's friends
      congratulated him upon his "great luck in getting the appointment, against
      the man, too, that Mr. Marcus had proposed and favoured."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcus, who was jealous in the extreme of power, and who made every trifle
      a matter of party competition, was vexed at the preference given against
      <i>an honest man</i> and a <i>friend</i> of his own, in favour of
      Moriarty, a catholic; a fellow he had always disliked, and a protege of
      Mr. Ormond. Ormond, though obliged to Sir Ulick for this kindness to
      Moriarty, was too intent on other things to think much about the matter.
      <i>When</i> he should see Florence Annaly again, seemed to him the only
      question in the universe of great importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this time arrived letters for Mr. Ormond, from Paris, from M. and
      Mad. de Connal; very kind letters, with pressing invitations to him to pay
      them a visit. M. de Connal informed him, "that the five hundred pounds,
      King Corny's legacy, was ready waiting his orders. M. de Connal hoped to
      put it into Mr. Ormond's hands in Paris in his own hotel, where he trusted
      that Mr. Ormond would do him the pleasure of soon occupying the apartments
      which were preparing for him." It did not clearly appear whether they had
      or had not heard of his accession of fortune. Dora's letter was not from
      <i>Dora</i>&mdash;it was from <i>Mad. de Connal</i>. It was on green
      paper, with a border of Cupids and roses, and store of sentimental devices
      in the corners. The turn of every phrase, the style, as far as Ormond
      could judge, was quite French&mdash;aiming evidently at being perfectly
      Parisian. Yet it was a letter so flattering to the vanity of man as might
      well incline him to excuse the vanity of woman. "Besides," as Sir Ulick
      O'Shane observed, "after making due deductions for French sentiment, there
      remains enough to satisfy an honest English heart that the lady really
      desires to see you, Ormond; and that now, in the midst of her Parisian
      prosperity, she has the grace to wish to show kindness to her father's
      adopted son, and to the companion and friend of her childhood." Sir Ulick
      was of opinion that Ormond could not do better than accept the invitation.
      Ormond was surprised, for he well recollected the manner in which his
      guardian had formerly, and not many months ago, written and spoken of
      Connal as a coxcomb and something worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," said Sir Ulick; "but that was when I was angry about your
      legacy, which was of great consequence to us then, though of none now&mdash;I
      certainly did suspect the man of a design to cheat you; but it is clear
      that I was wrong&mdash;I am ready candidly to acknowledge that I did him
      injustice. Your money is at your order&mdash;and I have nothing to say,
      but to beg M. de Connal ten thousand French pardons. Observe, I do not beg
      pardon for calling him a coxcomb, for a coxcomb he certainly is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An insufferable coxcomb!" cried Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a coxcomb <i>in fashion</i>," said Sir Ulick; "and a coxcomb in
      fashion is a useful connexion. He did not fable about Versailles&mdash;I
      have made particular inquiries from our ambassador at Paris, and he writes
      me word that Connal is often at court&mdash;<i>en bonne odeur</i> at
      Versailles. The ambassador says he meets the Connals every where in the
      first circles&mdash;how they came there I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to hear that, for Dora's sake," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always thought her a sweet, pretty little creature," said Sir Ulick,
      "and no doubt she has been polished up; and dress and fashion make such a
      difference in a woman&mdash;I suppose she is now ten times better&mdash;that
      is, prettier: she will introduce you at Paris, and your own <i>merit</i>&mdash;that
      is, manners, and figure, and fortune&mdash;will make your way every where.
      By-the-bye, I do not see a word about poor Mademoiselle&mdash;Oh, yes!
      here is a Line squeezed in at the edge&mdash;'Mille tendres souvenirs de
      la part de Mdlle. O'Faley.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Mademoiselle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Mademoiselle!" repeated Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean <i>that thing half Irish, half French, half mud, half tinsel?</i>"
      said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good memory! very sly, Harry! But still in the Irish half of her I
      dare say there is a heart; and we must allow her the tinsel, in pure
      gratitude, for having taught you to speak French so well&mdash;that will
      be a real advantage to you in Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever I go there, sir," said Ormond, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick was very much disappointed at perceiving that Ormond had no mind
      to go to Paris; but dropping the subject, he turned the conversation upon
      the Annalys: he praised Florence to the skies, hoped that Ormond would be
      more fortunate than Marcus had been, for somehow or other, he should never
      live or die in peace till Florence Annaly was more nearly connected with
      him. He regretted, however, that poor Sir Herbert was carried off before
      he had completed the levying of those fines, which would have cut off the
      entail, and barred the heir-at-law from the Herbert estates. Florence was
      not now the great heiress it was once expected she should be; indeed she
      had but a moderate gentlewoman's fortune&mdash;not even what at Smithfield
      a man of Ormond's fortune might expect; but Sir Ulick knew, he said, that
      this would make no difference to his ward, unless to make him in greater
      impatience to propose for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to be in greater impatience to propose for her than
      Ormond was. Sir Ulick did not wonder at it; but he thought that Miss
      Annaly would not, <i>could</i> not, listen to him yet. <i>Time, the
      comforter</i>, must come first; and while time was doing this business,
      love could not decently be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was the reason," said Ulick, returning by another road to the
      charge, "why I advised a trip to Paris; but you know best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot bear this suspense&mdash;I must and will know my fate&mdash;I
      will write instantly, and obtain an answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so; and to save time, I can tell what your fate and your answer will
      be: from Florence Annaly, assurance of perfect esteem and regard, as far
      as friendship, perhaps; but she will tell you that she cannot think of
      love at present. Lady Annaly, prudent Lady Annaly, will say that she hopes
      Mr. Ormond will not think of settling for life till he has seen something
      more of the world. Well, you don't believe me," said Sir Ulick,
      interrupting himself just at the moment when he saw that Ormond began to
      think there was some sense in what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't believe me, Harry," continued he, "consult your oracle, Dr.
      Cambray: he has just returned from Annaly, and he can tell you how the
      land lies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cambray agreed with Sir Ulick that both Lady Annaly and her daughter
      would desire that Ormond should see more of the world before he settled
      for life; but as to going off to Paris, without waiting to see or write to
      them, Dr. Cambray agreed with Ormond that it would be the worst thing he
      could do&mdash;that so far from appearing a proof of his respect to their
      grief, it would only seem a proof of indifference, or a sign of
      impatience: they would conclude that he was in haste to leave his friends
      in adversity, to go to those in prosperity, and to enjoy the gaiety and
      dissipation of Paris. Dr. Cambray advised that he should remain quietly
      where he was, and wait till Miss Annaly should be disposed to see him.
      This was most prudent, Ormond allowed. "But then the delay!" To conquer by
      delay we must begin by conquering our impatience: now that was what our
      hero could not possibly do&mdash;therefore he jumped hastily to this
      conclusion, that "in love affairs no man should follow any mortal's
      opinion but his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he sat down and wrote to Miss Annaly a most passionate letter,
      enclosed in a most dutiful one to Lady Annaly, as full of respectful
      attachment and entire obedience, as a son-in-law expectant could devise&mdash;beginning
      very properly and very sincerely, with anxiety and hopes about her
      ladyship's health, and ending, as properly, and as sincerely, with hopes
      that her ladyship would permit him, as soon as possible, to take from her
      the greatest, the only remaining source of happiness she had in life&mdash;her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having worded this very plausibly&mdash;for he had now learned how to
      write a letter&mdash;our hero despatched a servant of Sir Ulick's with his
      epistle; ordering him to wait certainly for an answer, but above all
      things to make haste back. Accordingly the man took a cross road&mdash;a
      short cut, and coming to a bridge, which he did not know was broken down
      till he was <i>close upon it</i>, he was obliged to return and to go
      round, and did not get home till long after dark&mdash;and the only answer
      he brought was, that there was no answer&mdash;only Lady Annaly's
      compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond could scarcely believe that no answer had been sent; but the man
      took all the saints in heaven, or in the calendar, to witness, that he
      would not tell his honour, or any <i>jantleman</i>, a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a cross-examination, the man gave proof that he had actually seen
      both the ladies. They were sitting so and so, and dressed so and so, in
      mourning. Farther, he gave undeniable proof that he had delivered the
      letters, and that they had been opened and read; for&mdash;<i>by the same
      token</i>&mdash;he was summoned up to my lady on account of one of Mr.
      Ormond's letters, he did not know <i>which</i>, or to <i>who</i>, being
      dated Monday, whereas it was Wednesday; and he had to clear himself of
      having been three days on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, inordinately impatient, could not rest a moment. The next morning
      he set off at full speed for Annaly, determined to find out what was the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived there, a new footman came to the door with "<i>Not at home</i>,
      sir." Ormond could have knocked him down, but he contented himself with
      striking his own forehead&mdash;however, in a genteel proper voice, he
      desired to see Sir Herbert's own man, O'Reilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. O'Reilly is not here, sir&mdash;absent on business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing was adverse. Ormond had one hope, that this new fellow, not
      knowing him, might by mistake have included him in a general order against
      morning visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Ormond, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I beg you will let Lady Annaly and Miss Annaly know that Mr. Ormond
      is come to pay his respects to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man seemed very unwilling to carry any message to his ladies. "He was
      sure," he said, "that the ladies would not see anybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was Lady Annaly ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her ladyship had been but poorly, but was better within the last two
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Miss Annaly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful better, too, sir; has got up her spirits greatly to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad to hear it," said Ormond. "Pray, sir, can you tell me
      whether a servant from Mr. Ormond brought a letter here yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was there any answer sent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really can't say, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be so good to take my name to your lady," repeated Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, I don't like to go in, for I know my lady&mdash;both my
      ladies is engaged, very particularly engaged&mdash;however, if you very
      positively desire it, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond did very positively desire it, and the footman obeyed. While Ormond
      was waiting impatiently for the answer, his horse, as impatient as
      himself, would not stand still. A groom, who was sauntering about, saw the
      uneasiness of the horse, and observing that it was occasioned by a
      peacock, who, with spread tail, was strutting in the sunshine, he ran and
      chased the bird away. Ormond thanked the groom, and threw him a <i>luck
      token</i>; but not recollecting his face, asked how long he had been at
      Annaly. "I think you were not here when I was here last?" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir." said the man, looking a little puzzled; "I never was here till
      the day before yesterday in my born days. We <i>bees</i> from England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, I and master&mdash;that is, master and I." Ormond grew pale; but
      the groom saw nothing of it&mdash;his eyes had fixed upon Ormond's horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very fine horse this of yours, sir, for sartain, if he could but <i>stand</i>,
      sir; he's main restless at a door. My master's horse is just his match for
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pray who is your master, sir?" said Ormond, in a voice which he
      forced to be calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My master, sir, is one Colonel Albemarle, son of the famous General
      Albemarle, as lost his arm, sir, you might have heard talk of, time back,"
      said the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a window-blind was flapped aside, and before the wind blew
      it back to its place again, Ormond saw Florence Annaly sitting on a sofa,
      and a gentleman, in regimentals, kneeling at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my eyes!" cried the groom, "what made you let go his bridle, sir?
      Only you sat him well, sir, he would ha' thrown you that minute&mdash;Curse
      the blind! that flapped in his eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman re-appeared on the steps. "Sir, it is just as I said&mdash;I
      could not be let in. Mrs. Spencer, my lady's woman, says the ladies is
      engaged&mdash;you can't see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had seen enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir," said he&mdash;"Mr. Ormond's compliments&mdash;he called,
      that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond put spurs to his horse, and galloped off; and, fast as he went, he
      urged his horse still faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the agony of disappointed love and jealousy, he railed bitterly against
      the whole sex, and against Florence Annaly in particular. Many were the
      rash vows he made that he would never think of her more&mdash;that he
      would tear her from his heart&mdash;that he would show her that he was no
      whining lover, no easy dupe, to be whiffled off and on, the sport of a
      coquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A coquette!&mdash;is it possible, Florence Annaly?&mdash;<i>You</i>&mdash;and
      after all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain tender recollections obtruded; but he repelled them&mdash;he would
      not allow one of them to mitigate his rage. His naturally violent passion
      of anger, now that it broke again from the control of his reason, seemed
      the more ungovernable from the sense of past and the dread of future
      restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when a horse naturally violent, and half trained to the curb, takes
      fright, or takes offence, and, starting, throws his master, away he
      gallops; enraged the more by the falling bridle, he rears, plunges,
      curvets, and lashes out behind at broken girth or imaginary pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! what is the matter with you, my dear boy?&mdash;what has
      happened?" cried Sir Ulick, the moment he saw him; for the disorder of
      Ormond's mind appeared strongly in his face and gestures&mdash;still more
      strongly in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he attempted to give an account of what had happened, it was so
      broken, so exclamatory, that it was wonderful how Sir Ulick made out the
      plain fact. Sir Ulick, however, well understood the short-hand language of
      the passions: he listened with eager interest&mdash;he sympathized so
      fully with Ormond's feelings&mdash;expressed such astonishment, such
      indignation, that Harry, feeling him to be his warm friend, loved him as
      heartily as in the days of his childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick saw and seized the advantage: he had almost despaired of
      accomplishing his purpose&mdash;now was the critical instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry Ormond," said he, "would you make Florence Annaly feel to the quick&mdash;would
      you make her repent in sackcloth and ashes&mdash;would you make her pine
      for you, ay! till her very heart is sick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I? to be sure&mdash;show me how!&mdash;only show me how!" cried
      Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look ye, Harry! to have and to hold a woman&mdash;trust me, for I have
      had and held many&mdash;to have and to hold a woman, you must first show
      her that you can, if you will, fling her from you&mdash;ay! and leave her
      there: set off for Paris to-morrow morning&mdash;my life upon it, the
      moment she hears you are gone, she will wish you back again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll set off to-night," said Ormond, ringing the bell to give orders to
      his servant to prepare immediately for his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Sir Ulick, seizing precisely the moment when Ormond's mind was at the
      right heat, aiming with dexterity and striking with force, bent and
      moulded him to his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      While preparations for Ormond's journey were making, Sir Ulick said that
      there was one thing he must insist upon his doing before he quitted Castle
      Hermitage&mdash;he must look over and settle his guardianship accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, whose head was far from business at this moment, was very
      reluctant: he said that the accounts could wait till he should return from
      France; but Sir Ulick observed that if he, or if Ormond were to die,
      leaving the thing unsettled, it would be loss of property to the one, and
      loss of credit to the other. Ormond then begged that the accounts might be
      sent after him to Paris; he would look over them there at leisure, and
      sign them. No, Sir Ulick said, they ought to be signed by some forthcoming
      witness in this country. He urged it so much, and put it upon the footing
      of his own credit and honour in such a manner, that Ormond could not
      refuse. He seized the papers, and took a pen to sign them; but Sir Ulick
      snatched the pen from his hand, and absolutely insisted upon his first
      knowing what he was going to sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole account could have been looked over while we have been talking
      about it," said Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond sat down and looked it over, examined all the vouchers, saw that
      every thing was perfectly right and fair, signed the accounts, and
      esteemed Sir Ulick the more for having insisted upon showing, and proving
      that all was exact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ulick offered to manage his affairs for him while he was away,
      particularly a large sum which Ormond had in the English funds. Sir Ulick
      had a banker and a broker in London, on whom he could depend, and he had,
      from his place and connexions, means of obtaining good information in
      public affairs; he had made a great deal himself by speculations in the
      funds, and he could buy in and sell out to great advantage, he said, for
      Ormond. But for this purpose a <i>power of attorney</i> was necessary to
      be given by Ormond to Sir Ulick.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was scarcely time to draw one up, nor was Sir Ulick sure that there
      was a printed form in the house. Luckily, however, a proper <i>power</i>
      was found, and filled up, and Ormond had just time to sign it before he
      stepped into the carriage: he embraced his guardian, and thanked him
      heartily for his care of the interests of his purse, and still more for
      the sympathy he had shown in the interests of his heart. Sir Ulick was
      moved at parting with him, and this struck Harry the more, because he
      certainly struggled to suppress his feelings. Ormond stopped at Vicar's
      Dale to tell Dr. Cambray all that had happened, to thank him and his
      family for their kindness, and to take leave of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were indeed astonished when he entered, saying, "Any commands, my
      good friends, for London or Paris? I am on my way there&mdash;carriage at
      the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they could not believe him to be serious; but when they heard his
      story, and saw by the agitation of his manner that he was in earnest, they
      were still more surprised at the suddenness of his determination. They all
      believed and represented to him that there must be some mistake, and that
      he was not cool enough to judge sanely at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cambray observed that Miss Annaly could not prevent any man from
      kneeling to her. Ormond haughtily said, "He did not know what she could
      prevent, he only knew what she did. She had not vouchsafed an answer to
      his letter&mdash;she had not admitted him. These he thought were
      sufficient indications that the person at her feet was accepted. Whether
      he were or not, Ormond would inquire no further. She might now accept or
      refuse, as she pleased&mdash;he would go to Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends had nothing more to say or to do, but to sigh, and to wish him
      a good journey, and much pleasure at Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond now requested that Dr. Cambray would have the goodness to write to
      him from time to time, to inform him of whatever he might wish to know
      during his absence. He was much mortified to hear from the doctor that he
      was obliged to proceed, with his family, for some months, to a distant
      part of the north of England; and that, as to the Annalys, they were
      immediately removing to the sea-coast of Devonshire, for the benefit of a
      mild climate and of sea-bathing. Ormond, therefore, had no resource but in
      his guardian. Sir Ulick's affairs, however, were to take him over to
      London, from whence Ormond could not expect much satisfactory intelligence
      with respect to Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond flew to Dublin, crossed the channel in an express boat, travelled
      night and day in the mail to London, from thence to Dover&mdash;crossed
      the water in a storm, and travelled with the utmost expedition to Paris,
      though there was no one reason why he should be in haste; and for so much,
      his travelling was as little profitable or amusing as possible. He saw,
      heard, and understood nothing, till he reached Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that the traveller without sensibility may travel from
      Dan to Beersheba, without finding any thing worth seeing. The traveller
      who has too much sensibility often observes as little&mdash;of this all
      persons must be sensible, who have ever travelled when their minds were
      engrossed with painful feelings, or possessed by any strong passion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ormond had written to M. and Madame de Connal to announce his intentions
      of spending some time in Paris, and to thank them for the invitation to
      their house; an invitation which, however, he declined accepting; but he
      requested M. de Connal to secure apartments for him in some hotel near
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his arrival he found every thing prepared for a Milord Anglois:
      handsome apartments, fashionable carriage, well-powdered laquais, and a
      valet-de-chambre, waited the orders of monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal was with him a few minutes after his arrival&mdash;welcomed him to
      Paris with cordial gaiety&mdash;was more glad, and more sorry, and said
      more in five minutes, and above all made more protestations of regard,
      than an Englishman would make in a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rejoiced&mdash;delighted&mdash;enchanted to see Mr. Ormond. Madame
      de Connal was absolutely transported with joy when she heard he was on his
      road to Paris. Madame was now at Versailles; but she would return in a few
      days: she would be in despair at Mr. Ormond's not accepting the apartments
      in the Hotel de Connal, which were actually prepared for him; but in fact
      it was nearly the same thing, within two doors of them. He hoped Mr.
      Ormond liked his apartments&mdash;but in truth that was of little
      consequence, for he would never be in them, except when he was asleep or
      dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond thought the apartments quite superb, and was going to have thanked
      M. de Connal for the trouble he had taken; but at the word <i>superbe</i>,
      Connal ran on again with French vivacity of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, Mr. Ormond ought," he said, "to have every thing now in the
      first style." He congratulated our hero on his accession of fortune, "of
      which Madame de Connal and he had heard with inexpressible joy. And Mdlle.
      O'Faley, too, she who had always prophesied that they should meet in
      happiness at Paris, was now absolutely in ecstasy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no idea, in short, my dear Ormond, of what a strong impression
      you left on all our minds&mdash;no conception of the lively interest you
      always inspired."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lively interest which had slumbered quietly for a considerable
      time, but now it wakened with perfectly good grace. Ormond set little
      value on these sudden protestations, and his pride felt a sort of fear
      that it should be supposed he was deceived by them; yet, altogether, the
      manner was agreeable, and Connal was essentially useful at this moment: as
      Sir Ulick had justly observed, a coxcomb in fashion may, in certain
      circumstances, be a useful friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear fellow," cried Connal, "what savage cut your hair last?&mdash;It
      is a sin to trust your fine head to the barbarians&mdash;my hairdresser
      shall be with you in the twinkling of an eye: I will send my tailor&mdash;allow
      me to choose your embroidery, and see your lace, before you decide&mdash;I
      am said to have a tolerable taste&mdash;the ladies say so, and they are
      always the best judges. The French dress will become you prodigiously, I
      foresee&mdash;but, just Heaven!&mdash;what buckles!&mdash;those must have
      been made before the flood: no disparagement to your taste, but what could
      you do better in the Black Islands? Paris is the only place for <i>bijouterie</i>&mdash;except
      in steel, Paris surpasses the universe&mdash;your eyes will be dazzled by
      the Palais Royal. But this hat!&mdash;you know it can't appear&mdash;it
      would destroy you: my <i>chapelier</i> shall be with you instantly. It
      will all be done in five minutes&mdash;you have no idea of the celerity
      with which you may command every thing at Paris. But I am so sorry that
      madame is at Versailles, and that I am under a necessity of being there
      myself to-morrow for the rest of this week; but I have a friend, a little
      <i>Abb</i>, who will be delighted in the mean time to show you Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment of his arrival at Paris, Ormond resolved to put Florence
      Annaly completely out of his thoughts, and to drown in gaiety and
      dissipation the too painful recollection of her duplicity towards him. He
      was glad to have a few days to look about him, and to see something of
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should like, as he told M. de Connal, to go to the play, to accustom
      himself to the language. He must wear off his English or Irish awkwardness
      a little, before he should be presented to Madame de Connal, or appear in
      French society. A profusion of compliments followed from M. de Connal; but
      Ormond persisting, it was settled that he should go incog. this night to
      the Thtre Franois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal called upon him in the evening, and took him to the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in <i>une petite loge</i>, where they could see without being
      seen. In the box with them was the young Abb, and a pretty little French
      actress, Mdlle. Adrienne. At the first coup-d'oeil, the French ladies did
      not strike him as handsome; they looked, as he said, like dolls, all eyes
      and rouge; and rouge, as he thought, very unbecomingly put on, in one
      frightful red patch or plaster, high upon the cheek, without any pretence
      to the imitation of natural colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh fi donc!" said the Abb, "what you call the natural colour, that would
      be <i>rouge coquette</i>, which no woman of quality can permit herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Dieu merci," said the actress, "that is for us: 'tis very fair we
      should have some advantages in the competition, they have so many&mdash;by
      birth&mdash;if not by nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal explained to Ormond that the frightful red patch which
      offended his eye, was the mark of a woman of quality: "women only of a
      certain rank have the privilege of wearing their rouge in that manner&mdash;your
      eye will soon grow accustomed to it, and you will like it as a sign of
      rank and fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The actress shrugged her shoulders, said something about "<i>la belle
      nature</i>," and the good taste of Monsieur l'Anglois. The moment the
      curtain drew up, she told him the names of all the actors and actresses as
      they appeared&mdash;noting the value and celebrity of each. The play was,
      unfortunately for Ormond, a tragedy; and Le Kain was at Versailles. Ormond
      thought he understood French pretty well, but he did not comprehend what
      was going on. The French tone of tragic declamation, so unnatural to his
      ear, distracted his attention so much, that he could not make out the
      sense of what any of the actors said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis like the quality rouge," said Connal; "your taste must be formed to
      it. But your eye and your ear will accommodate themselves to both. You
      will like it in a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal said this was always the first feeling of foreigners. "But
      have patience," said he; "go on listening, and in a night or two, perhaps
      in an hour or two, the sense will break in upon you all at once. You will
      never find yourself at a loss in society. Talk, at all events, whether you
      speak ill or well, talk: don't aim at correctness&mdash;we don't expect it
      Besides, as they will tell you, we like to see how a stranger 'play with
      our language.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal's manner was infinitely more agreeable toward Ormond now than
      in former days.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was perhaps still at the bottom of his mind the same fund of
      self-conceit, but he did not take the same arrogant tone. It was the tone
      not of a superior to an inferior, but of a friend, in a new society, and a
      country to which he is a stranger. There was as little of the protector in
      his manner as possible, considering his natural presumption and acquired
      habits: considering that he had made his own way in Paris, and that he
      thought that to be the first man in a certain circle there, was to be
      nearly the first man in the universe. The next morning, the little Abb
      called to pay his compliments, and to offer his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal being obliged to go to Versailles, in his absence the Abb
      would be very happy, he said, to attend Mr. Ormond, and to show him Paris:
      he believed, he humbly said, that he had the means of showing him every
      thing that was worth his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gare! gare!" cried the coachman, chasing away the droves of walkers
      before him. There being no footpaths in the streets of Paris, they were
      continually driven up close to the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond at first shrunk at the sight of their peril and narrow escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur apparemment is nervous after his <i>voyage?</i>" said the Abb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I am afraid the people will be run over. I will make the coachman
      drive more quietly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Du tout!&mdash;not at all," said the little Abb, who was of a noble
      family, and had all the airs of it. "Leave him to settle it with the
      people&mdash;they are used to it. And, after all, what have they to think
      of, but to take care of themselves&mdash;<i>la cancille</i>?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>La canaille</i>," synonymous with the <i>swinish multitude</i>, an
      expression of contempt for which the Parisian nobility have since paid
      terribly dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, who was not used to it, found it difficult to abstract his
      sympathy from his fellow-creatures, by whatever name they were called; and
      he could not exclusively command his attention, to admire the houses and
      churches, which his Abb continually pointed out to his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He admired, however, the fine faade of the Louvre, the Place de Louis
      XV., the astonishingly brilliant spectacle of the Palais Royal, Notre
      Dame, a few handsome bridges, and the drives on the Boulevards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in fact there was at that time much more to be heard, and less to be
      seen, than at present in Paris. Paris was not then as fine a city as it
      now is. Ormond, in his secret soul, preferred the bay of Dublin to all he
      then saw on the banks of the Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Abb was not satisfied with the paucity of his exclamations,
      and would have given him up, as <i>un froid Anglois</i>, but that,
      fortunately, our young hero had each night an opportunity of redeeming his
      credit. They went to the play&mdash;he saw French comedy!&mdash;he saw and
      heard Molet, and Madame de la Ruette: the Abb was charmed with his
      delight, his enthusiasm, his genuine enjoyment of high comedy, and his
      quick feeling of dramatic excellence. It was indeed perfection&mdash;beyond
      any thing of which Ormond could have formed an idea. Every part well
      performed&mdash;nothing to break the illusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      This first fit of dramatic enthusiasm was the third day at its height,
      when Connal returned from Versailles; and it was so strong upon him, and
      he was so full of Molet and Madame de la Ruette, that he could scarcely
      listen to what Connal said of Versailles, the king's supper, and Madame la
      Dauphine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt&mdash;he should like to see all that&mdash;but at all events he
      was positively determined to see Molet, and Madame de la Ruette, every
      night they acted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal smiled, and only answered, "Of course he would do as he pleased."
      But in the mean time, it was now Madame de Connal's <i>night</i> for
      seeing company, and he was to make his debut in a French assembly. Connal
      called for him early, that they might have a few minutes to themselves
      before the company should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond felt some curiosity, a little anxiety, a slight flutter at the
      heart, at the thought of seeing Dora again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of her husband interrupted these thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal took the light from the hands of Crepin, the valet, and reviewed
      Ormond from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Crepin: you have done your part, and Nature has done hers, for
      Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly," said Crepin, "Nature has done wonders for Monsieur; and
      Monsieur, now he is dressed, has really all the air of a Frenchman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite l'air comme il faut! l'air noble!" added Connal; and he agreed with
      Crepin in opinion that French dress made an astonishing difference in Mr.
      Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame de Connal, I am sure, will think so," continued Connal, "will see
      it with admiration&mdash;for she really has good taste. I will pledge
      myself for your success. With that figure, with that air, you will turn
      many heads in Paris&mdash;if you will but talk enough. Say every thing
      that comes into your head&mdash;don't be like an Englishman, always
      thinking about the sense&mdash;the more nonsense the better&mdash;trust me&mdash;<i>livrez-vous</i>&mdash;let
      yourself out&mdash;follow me, and fear nothing," cried he, running down
      stairs, delighted with Ormond and with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He foresaw that he should gain credit by <i>producing</i> such a man. He
      really wished that Ormond should <i>succeed</i> in French society, and
      that he should pass his time agreeably in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man could feel better disposed towards another. Even if he should take
      a fancy to Madame, it was to the polite French husband a matter of
      indifference, except so far as the <i>arrangement</i> might, or might not,
      interfere with his own views.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these views&mdash;what were they?&mdash;Only to win all the young
      man's fortune at play. A cela prs&mdash;excepting this, he was sincerely
      Ormond's friend, ready to do every thing possible&mdash;de faire
      l'impossible&mdash;to oblige and entertain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal enjoyed Ormond's surprise at the magnificence of his hotel. After
      ascending a spacious staircase, and passing through antechamber after
      antechamber, they reached the splendid salon, blazing with lights,
      reflected on all sides in mirrors, that reached from the painted ceiling
      to the inlaid floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a creature here yet&mdash;happily." "Madame begs," said the servant,
      "that Monsieur will pass on into the boudoir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any body with Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one but Madame de Clairville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only <i>l'amie intime</i>," said Connal, "the bosom friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How will Dora feel?&mdash;How will it be with us both?" thought Ormond,
      as he followed the light step of the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entrez!&mdash;Entrez toujours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond stopped at the threshold, absolutely dazzled by the brilliancy of
      Dora's beauty, her face, her figure, her air, so infinitely improved, so
      fashioned!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dora!&mdash;Ah! Madame de Connal," cried Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      No French actor could have done it better than nature did it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora gave one glance at Ormond&mdash;pleasure, joy, sparkled in her eyes;
      then leaning on the lady who stood beside her, almost sinking, Dora
      sighed, and exclaimed, "Ah! Harry Ormond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah ciel!" said l'amie intime, looking towards Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help me to support her, Monsieur&mdash;while I seek de l'eau de Cologne."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, seized with sudden tremor, could scarcely advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora sunk on the sofa, clasping her beautiful hands, and exclaiming, "The
      companion of my earliest days!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ormond, excused to himself, sprang forward,&mdash;"Friend of my
      childhood!" cried he: "yes, my sister: your father promised me this
      friendship&mdash;this happiness," said he supporting her, as she raised
      herself from the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O est-il? o est-il?&mdash;Where is he, Monsieur Ormond?" cried
      Mademoiselle, throwing open the door. "Ah ciel, comme il est beau! A
      perfect Frenchman already! And how much embellished by dress!&mdash;Ah!
      Paris for that. Did I not prophesy?&mdash;Dora, my darling, do me the
      justice.&mdash;But&mdash;comme vous voil saisie!&mdash;here's l'amie with
      l'eau de Cologne. Ah! my child, recover yourself, for here is some one&mdash;the
      Comte de Jarillac it is entering the salon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The promptitude of Dora's recovery was a new surprise to our hero. "Follow
      me," said she to him, and with Parisian ease and grace she glided into the
      salon to receive M. de Jarillac&mdash;presented Ormond to M. le Comte&mdash;"Anglois&mdash;Irlandois&mdash;an
      English, an Irish gentleman&mdash;the companion of her childhood," with
      the slightest, lightest tone of sentiment imaginable; and another count
      and another came, and a baron, and a marquis, and a duke, and Madame la
      Comtesse de &mdash;&mdash;, and Madame la Duchesse &mdash;&mdash;; and all
      were received with ease, respect, vivacity, or sentiment as the occasion
      required&mdash;now advancing a step or two to mark <i>empressement</i>
      where requisite;&mdash;regaining always, imperceptibly, the most
      advantageous situation and attitude for herself;&mdash;presenting Ormond
      to every one&mdash;quite intent upon him, yet appearing entirely occupied
      with every body else; and, in short, never forgetting them, him, or
      herself for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can this be Dora?" thought Ormond in admiration, yet in astonishment that
      divided his feelings. It was indeed wonderful to see how quickly, how
      completely, the Irish country girl had been metamorphosed into a French
      woman of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now surrounded by admirers, by adorers in embroidery and blazing with
      crosses and stars, she received <i>les hommages</i>&mdash;enjoyed <i>le
      succs</i>&mdash;accepted the incense without bending too low or holding
      herself too high&mdash;not too sober, nor too obviously intoxicated.
      Vanity in all her heart, yet vanity not quite turning her head, not more
      than was agreeable and becoming&mdash;extending her smiles to all, and
      hoping all the time that Harry Ormond envied each. Charmed with him&mdash;for
      her early passion for him had revived in an instant&mdash;the first sight
      of his figure and air, the first glance in the boudoir, had been
      sufficient. She knew, too, how well he would <i>succeed</i> at Paris&mdash;how
      many rivals she would have in a week: these perceptions, sensations, and
      conclusions, requiring so much time in slow words to express, had darted
      through Dora's head in one instant, had exalted her imagination, and
      touched her heart&mdash;as much as that heart could be touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond meantime breathed more freely, and recovered from his tremors.
      Madame de Connal, surrounded by adorers, and shining in the salon, was not
      so dangerous as Dora, half fainting in the boudoir; nor had any words that
      wit or sentiment could devise power to please or touch him so much as the
      "<i>Harry Ormond</i>!" which had burst naturally from Dora's lips. Now he
      began almost to doubt whether nature or art prevailed. Now he felt himself
      safe at least, since he saw that it was only the coquette of the Black
      Islands transformed into the coquette of the Hotel de Connal. The
      transformation was curious, was admirable; Ormond thought he could admire
      without danger, and, in due time, perhaps gallant, with the best of them,
      without feeling&mdash;without scruple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tables were now arranging for play. The conversation he heard every
      where round him related to the good or bad fortune of the preceding
      nights. Ormond perceived that it was the custom of the house to play every
      evening, and the expressions that reached him about bets and debts
      confirmed the hint which his guardian had given him, that Connal played
      high.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, however, he did not seem to have any design upon Ormond&mdash;he
      was engaged at the further end of the room. He left him quite to himself,
      and to Madame, and never once even asked him to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed more danger of his being <i>left out</i>, than of his being
      <i>taken in</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Donnez-moi le bras&mdash;Come with me, Monsieur Ormond," said
      Mademoiselle, "and you shall lose nothing&mdash;while they are settling
      about their parties, we can get one little moment's chat."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him back to the boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to make you know our Paris," said she: "here we can see the whole
      world pass in review, and I shall tell you every thing most necessary for
      you to know; for example&mdash;who is who&mdash;and still more it imports
      you to know who and who are together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that lady, beautiful as the day, in diamonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame de Connal, do you mean?" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! no; not her always," said Mademoiselle: "though she has the apple
      here, without contradiction," continued Mademoiselle, still speaking in
      English, which it was always her pride to speak to whomsoever could
      understand her. "Absolutely, without vanity, though my niece, I may say
      it, she is a perfect creature&mdash;and mise  ravir!&mdash;Did you ever
      see such a change for the best in one season? Ah! Paris!&mdash;Did I not
      tell you well?&mdash;And you felt it well yourself&mdash;you lost your
      head, I saw that, at first sight of her <i> la Franoise</i>&mdash;the
      best proof of your taste and sensibilit&mdash;she has infinite
      sensibility too!&mdash;interesting, and at the height, what you English
      call the tip-top, of the fashion here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it appears, indeed," said Ormond, "by the crowd of admirers I see
      round Madame de Connal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirers! yes, adorers, you may say&mdash;encore, if you added lovers,
      you would not be much wrong; dying for love&mdash;perdument pris! See,
      there, he who is bowing now&mdash;Monsieur le Marquis de Beaulieu&mdash;homme
      de cour&mdash;plein d'esprit&mdash;homme marquant&mdash;very remarkable
      man. But&mdash;Ah! voil que entre&mdash;of the court. Did you ever see
      finer entre made by man into a room, so full of grace? Ah! le Comte de
      Belle Chasse&mdash;How many women already he has <i>lost</i>!&mdash;It is
      a real triumph to Madame de Connal to have him in her chains. What a
      smile!&mdash;C'est lui qui est aimable pour nous autres&mdash;d'une
      soumission pour les femmes&mdash;d'une fiert pour les hommes. As the lamb
      gentle for the pretty woman; as the lion terrible for the man. It is that
      Comte de Belle Chasse who is absolutely irresistible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Absolutely</i> irresistible," Ormond repeated, smiling; "not
      absolutely, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that is understood&mdash;you do not doubt la sagesse de Madame?&mdash;Besides,
      <i>heureusement</i>, there is an infinite safety for her in the number, as
      you see, of her adorers. Wait till I name them to you&mdash;I shall give
      you a catalogue raisonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      With rapid enunciation Mademoiselle went through the names and rank of the
      circle of adorers, noting with complacency the number of ladies to whom
      each man of gallantry was supposed to have paid his addresses&mdash;next
      to being of the blood royal, this appearing to be of the highest
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And  propos, Monsieur d'Ormond, you, yourself, when do you count to go
      to Versailles?&mdash;Ah!&mdash;when you shall see the king and the king's
      supper, and Madame la Dauphine! Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle was recalled from the ecstasy in which she had thrown up her
      eyes to Heaven, by some gentleman speaking to her as he passed the open
      door of the boudoir arm in arm with a lady&mdash;Mademoiselle answered,
      with a profound inclination of the head, whispering to Ormond after they
      had passed, "M. le Due de C&mdash;&mdash; with Madame de la Tour. Why he
      is constant always to that woman, Heaven knows better than me! Stand, if
      you are so good, Monsieur, a little more this way, and give your attention&mdash;they
      don't want you yet at play."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then designating every person at the different card-tables, she said,
      "That lady is the wife of M.&mdash;&mdash;, and there is M. le Baron de L&mdash;&mdash;
      her lover, the gentleman who looks over her cards&mdash;and that other
      lady with the joli pompon, she is intimate with M. de la Tour, the husband
      of the lady who passed with M. le Duc." Mademoiselle explained all these
      arrangements with the most perfect sang froid, as things of course, that
      every body knew and spoke of, except just before the husbands; but there
      was no mystery, no concealment: "What use?&mdash;To what good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond asked whether there were <i>any</i> ladies in the room who were
      supposed to be faithful to their husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!&mdash;Ma nice, par exemple, Madame de Connal, I may cite as a woman
      of la plus belle rputation, sans tche&mdash;what you call unblemish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly," said Ormond, "you could not, I hope, think me so indiscreet&mdash;I
      believe I said <i>ladies</i> in the plural number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! oui, assuredly, and I can name you twenty. To begin, there, do you
      see that woman standing up, who has the air as if she think of nothing at
      all, and nobody thinking of her, with only her husband near her, <i>cet
      grand homme blme?</i>&mdash;There is Madame de la Rousse&mdash;<i>d'une
      rputation intacte!</i>&mdash;frightfully dressed, as she is always. But,
      hold, you see that pretty little Comtesse de la Brie, all in white?&mdash;Charmante!
      I give her to you as a reputation against which slander cannot breathe&mdash;Nouvelle
      marie&mdash;bride&mdash;in what you call de honey-moon; but we don't know
      that in French&mdash;no matter! Again, since you are curious in these
      things, there is another reputation without spot, Madame de St. Ange, I
      warrant her to you&mdash;bien froide, celle-l, cold as any English&mdash;married
      a full year, and still her choice to make; allons,&mdash;there is three I
      give you already, without counting my niece; and, wait, I will find you
      yet another," said Mademoiselle, looking carefully through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was relieved from her difficulty by the entrance of the little Abb,
      who came to summon Monsieur to Madame de Connal, who did him the honour to
      invite him to the table. Ormond played, and fortune smiled upon him, as
      she usually does upon a new votary; and beauty smiled upon him perhaps on
      the same principle. Connal never came near him till supper was announced;
      then only to desire him to give his arm to a charming little Countess&mdash;la
      nouvelle marie&mdash;Madame de Connal, belonging, by right of rank, to
      Monsieur le Comte de Belle Chasse. The supper was one of the delightful <i>petit
      soupers</i> for which Paris was famous at that day, and which she will
      never see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moralist, who considers the essential interests of morality, more than
      the immediate pleasures of society, will think this rather a matter of
      rejoicing than regret. How far such society and correct female conduct be
      compatible, is a question which it might take too long a time to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, be it sufficient here to say, that Ormond, without staying to
      examine it, was charmed with the present effect; with the gaiety, the wit,
      the politeness, the ease, and altogether with that indescribable thing,
      that untranslatable esprit de socit. He could not afterwards remember
      any thing very striking or very solid that had been said, but all was
      agreeable at the moment, and there was great variety. Ormond's self-love
      was, he knew not how, flattered. Without effort, it seemed to be the
      object of every body to make Paris agreeable to him; and they convinced
      him that he would find it the most charming place in the world&mdash;without
      any disparagement to his own country, to which all solid honours and
      advantages were left undisputed. The ladies, whom he had thought so little
      captivating at first view, at the theatre, were all charming on <i>farther
      acquaintance</i>: so full of vivacity, and something so flattering in
      their manner, that it put a stranger at once at his ease. Towards the end
      of the supper he found himself talking to two very pretty women at once,
      with good effect, and thinking at the same time of Dora and the Comte de
      Belle Chasse. Moreover, he thought he saw that Dora was doing the same
      between the irresistible Comte, and the Marquis, plein d'esprit, from
      whom, while she was listening and talking without intermission, her eyes
      occasionally strayed, and once or twice met those of Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it indiscreet to ask you whether you passed your evening agreeably?"
      said M. de Connal, when the company had retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delightfully!" said Ormond: "the most agreeable evening I ever passed in
      my life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then fearing that he had spoken with too much enthusiasm, and that the
      husband might observe that his eyes, as he spoke, involuntarily turned
      towards Madame de Connal, he moderated (he might have saved himself the
      trouble), he moderated his expression by adding, that as far as he could
      yet judge, he thought French society very agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen nothing yet&mdash;you are right not to judge hastily," said
      Connal; "but so far, I am glad you are tolerably well satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! oui, Monsieur Ormond," cried Mademoiselle, joining them, "we shall
      fix you at Paris, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hope, I suppose you mean, my dear aunt," said Dora, with such
      flattering hope in her voice, and in the expression of her countenance,
      that Ormond decided that he "certainly intended to spend the winter at
      Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal, satisfied with this certainty, would have let Ormond go. But
      Mademoiselle had many compliments to make him and herself upon his
      pronunciation, and his fluency in speaking the French language&mdash;really
      like a Frenchman himself&mdash;the Marquis de Beaulieu had said to her:
      she was sure M. d'Ormond could not fail to <i>succeed</i> in Paris with
      that perfection added to all his other advantages. It was the greatest of
      all the advantages in the world&mdash;the greatest advantage in the <i>universe</i>,
      she was going on to say, but M. de Connal finished the flattery better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would pity us, Ormond," cried he, interrupting Mademoiselle, "if you
      could see and hear the Vandals they send to us from England with letters
      of introduction&mdash;barbarians, who can neither sit, stand, nor speak&mdash;nor
      even articulate the language. How many of these <i>butors</i>, rich, of
      good family, I have been sometimes called upon to introduce into society,
      and to present at court! Upon my honour it has happened to me to wish they
      might hang themselves out of my way, or be found dead in their beds the
      day I was to take them to Versailles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really too great a tax upon the good-breeding of the lady of the
      house," said Madame de Connal, "deplorable, when she has nothing better to
      say of an English guest than that 'Ce monsieur l a un grand talent pour
      le silence.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond, conscious that he had talked away at a great rate, was pleased by
      this indirect compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But such personnages muts never really see French society. They never
      obtain more than a supper&mdash;not a <i>petit souper</i>&mdash;no, no, an
      invitation to a great assembly, where they see nothing. Milord Anglois is
      lost in the crowd, or stuck across a door-way by his own sword. Now, what
      could any letter of recommendation do for such a fellow as that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letters of recommendation which are of most advantage," said Madame
      de Connal, "are those which are written in the countenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had presence of mind enough not to bow, though the compliment was
      directed distinctly to him&mdash;a look of thanks he knew was sufficient.
      As he retired, Mademoiselle, pursuing him to the door, begged that he
      would come as early as he could next morning, that she might introduce him
      to her apartments, and explain to him all the superior conveniences of a
      French house. M. de Connal representing, however, that the next day Mr.
      Ormond was to go to Versailles, Mademoiselle acknowledged <i>that</i> was
      an affair to which all others must yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well flattered by all the trio, and still more perhaps by his own vanity,
      our young hero was at last suffered to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first appearance at Versailles was a matter of great consequence.
      Court-dress was then an affair of as much importance at Paris as it seems
      to be now in London, if we may judge by the columns of birthday dresses,
      and the <i>honourable notice</i> of gentlemen's coats and waistcoats. It
      was then at Paris, however, as it is now and ever will be all over the
      world, essential to the appearance of a gentleman, that whatever time,
      pains, or expense, it might have cost, he should, from the moment he is
      dressed, <i>be</i>, or at least <i>seem</i> to be, above his dress. In
      this as in most cases, the shortest and safest way to <i>seem</i> is to <i>be</i>.
      Our young hero being free from personal conceit, or overweening anxiety
      about his appearance, looked at ease. He called at the Hotel de Connal the
      day he was to go to Versailles, and Mademoiselle was in ecstasy at the
      sight of his dress, exclaiming, "superbe!&mdash;magnifique!"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal seemed more struck with his air than his dress, and Dora,
      perhaps, was more pleased with his figure; she was silent, but it was a
      silence that spoke; her husband heeded not what it said, but, pursuing his
      own course, observed, that, to borrow the expression of Crepin, the
      valet-de-chambre, no contemptible judge in these cases, M. Ormond looked
      not only as if he was <i>n coiff</i>, but as if he had been born with a
      sword by his side. "Really, my dear friend," continued M. de Connal, "you
      look as if you had come at once full dressed into the world, which in our
      days is better than coming ready armed out of the head of Jupiter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. O'Faley, now seizing upon Ormond, whom she called her pupil,
      carried him off, to show him her apartments and the whole house; which she
      did with many useful notes&mdash;pointing out the convenience and entire
      liberty that result from the complete separation of the apartments of the
      husband and wife in French houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Monsieur et Madame with their own staircases, their own
      passages, their own doors in and out, and all separate for the people of
      Monsieur, and the women of Madame, and here through this little door you
      go into the apartments of Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's English foot stopped respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, entrez toujours," said Mademoiselle, as the husband had said before
      at the door of the boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Madame de Connal is dressing, perhaps," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Et puis?&mdash;and what then? you must get rid as fast as you can of your
      English prjugs&mdash;and she is not here neither," said Mademoiselle,
      opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Connal was in an inner apartment; and Ormond, the instant after
      he entered this room with Mademoiselle, heard a quick step, which he knew
      was Dora's, running to bolt the door of the inner room&mdash;he was glad
      that she had not quite got rid of her English prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mdlle. O'Faley pointed out to him all the accommodations of a French
      apartment: she had not at this moment the slightest <i>malice</i> or bad
      intention in any thing she was saying&mdash;she simply spoke in all the
      innocence of a Frenchwoman&mdash;if that term be intelligible. If she had
      any secret motive, it was merely the vanity of showing that she was quite
      Parisienne; and there again she was mistaken; for having lived half her
      life out of Paris, she had forgotten, if she ever had it, the tone of good
      society, and upon her return had overdone the matter, exaggerated French
      manners, to prove to her niece that she knew les usages, les convenances,
      les nuances&mdash;enfin, la mode de Paris! A more dangerous guide in Paris
      for a young married woman in every respect could scarcely be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Connal's valet now came to let Mr. Ormond know that Monsieur waited
      his orders. But for this interruption, he was in a fair way to hear all
      the private history of the family, all the secrets that Mademoiselle knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the amazing communicativeness of Frenchwomen on all subjects, our young
      hero had as yet no conception.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was during the latter years of the life of Louis the Fifteenth, and
      during the reign of Madame du Barry, that Ormond was at Paris. The court
      of Versailles was at this time in all its splendour, if not in all its
      glory. At the souper du roi, Ormond beheld, in all the magnificence of
      dress and jewels, the nobility, wealth, fashion, and beauty of France.
      Well might the brilliancy dazzle the eyes of a youth fresh from Ireland,
      when it amazed even old ambassadors, accustomed to the ordinary grandeur
      of courts. When he recovered from his first astonishment, when his eyes
      were a little better used to the light, and he looked round and considered
      all these magnificently decorated personages, assembled for the purpose of
      standing at a certain distance to see one man eat his supper, it did
      appear to him an extraordinary spectacle; and the very great solemnity and
      devotion of the assistants, so unsuited to the French countenance,
      inclined him to smile. It was well for him, however, that he kept his
      Irish risible muscles in order, and that no courtier could guess his
      thoughts&mdash;a smile would have lost him his reputation. Nothing in the
      world appeared to Frenchmen, formerly, of more importance than their court
      etiquette, though there were some who began about this time to suspect
      that the court order of things might not be co-existent with the order of
      nature&mdash;though there were some philosophers and statesmen who began
      to be aware, that the daily routine of the courtier's etiquette was not as
      necessary as the motions of the sun, moon, and planets. Nor could it have
      been possible to convince half at least of the crowd, who assisted at the
      king's supper this night, that all the French national eagerness about the
      health, the looks, the words, of <i>le roi</i>, all the attachment, <i>le
      dvouement</i>, professed habitually&mdash;perhaps felt habitually&mdash;for
      the reigning monarch, whoever or whatever he might be, by whatever name&mdash;notre
      bon roi, or simply notre roi de France&mdash;should in a few years pass
      away, and be no more seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond had no concern with the affairs of the nation, nor with the future
      fate of any thing he beheld: he was only a spectator, a foreigner; and his
      business was, according to Mademoiselle's maxim, to enjoy to-day and to
      reflect to-morrow. His enjoyment of this day was complete: he not only
      admired, but was admired. In the vast crowd he was distinguished: some
      nobleman of note asked who he was&mdash;another observed <i>l'air noble</i>&mdash;another
      exclaimed, "<i> Le bel Anglois</i>!" and his fortune was made at Paris;
      especially as a friend of Madame du Barry's asked where he bought his
      embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went afterwards, at least in Connal's society, by the name of "<i>Le
      bel Anglois</i>." Half in a tone of raillery, yet with a look that showed
      she felt it to be just, Madame de Connal first adopted the appellation,
      and then changed the term to "<i>mon bel Irlandois</i>." Invitations upon
      invitations poured upon Ormond&mdash;all were eager to have him at their
      parties&mdash;he was every where&mdash;attending Madame de Connal&mdash;and
      she, how proud to be attended by Ormond! He dreaded lest his principles
      should not withstand the strong temptation. He could not leave her, but he
      determined to see her only in crowds; accordingly, he avoided every select
      party: l'amie intime could never for the first three weeks get him to one
      <i>petit comit</i>, though Madame de Connal assured him that her friend's
      <i>petit soupers</i> "were charming, worth all the crowded assemblies in
      Paris." Still he pursued his plan, and sought for safety in a course of
      dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you joy," said Connal to him one day, "you are fairly launched!
      you are no distressed vessel to be <i>taken in tow</i>, nor a petty bark
      to sail in any man's <i>wake</i>. You have a gale, and are likely to have
      a triumph of your own." Connal was, upon all occasions, careful to impress
      upon Ormond's mind, that he left him wholly to himself, for he was aware,
      that in former days, he had offended his independent spirit by airs of
      protection. He managed better now&mdash;he never even invited him to play,
      though it was his main object to draw him to his faro-table. He made use
      of some of his friends or confederates, who played for him: Connal
      occasionally coming to the table as an unconcerned spectator. Ormond
      played with so much freedom, and seemed to have so gentlemanlike an
      indifference whether he lost or won, that he was considered as an easy
      dupe. Time only was necessary, M. de Connal thought, to lead him on
      gradually and without alarm, to let him warm to the passion for play.
      Meanwhile Madame de Connal felt as fully persuaded that Ormond's passion
      for her would increase. It was her object to <i>fix</i> him at Paris; but
      she should be content, perfectly happy with his friendship, his society,
      his sentiments: her own <i>sentiment</i> for him, as she confessed to
      Madame de Clairville, was absolutely invincible; but it should never lead
      her beyond the bounds of virtue. It was involuntary, but it should never
      be a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Clairville, who understood her business, and spoke with all the
      fashionable <i>cant</i> of sensibility, asked how it was possible that an
      involuntary sentiment could ever be a crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      As certainly as the novice among a band of sharpers is taught, by the
      technical language of the gang, to conquer his horror of crime, so
      certainly does the <i>cant of sentiment</i> operate upon the female
      novice, and vanquish her fear of shame and moral horror of vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The allusion is coarse&mdash;so much the better: strength, not elegance,
      is necessary on some occasions to make an impression. The truth will
      strike the good sense and good feelings of our countrywomen, and
      unadorned, they will prefer it to German or French sophistry. By such
      sophistry, however, was Dora insensibly led on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ormond did not yet advance in learning the language of sentiment&mdash;he
      was amusing himself in the world&mdash;and Dora imagined that the
      dissipation in which he lived prevented him from having time to think of
      his passion: she began to hate the dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal one day, when Dora was present, observed that Ormond seemed to be
      quite in his natural element in this sea of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who would have thought it?" said Dora: "I thought Mr. Ormond's taste was
      more for domestic happiness and retirement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Retirement at Paris!" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Domestic happiness at Paris!" said Connal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Connal sighed&mdash;No, it was Dora that sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you go to-night?" said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nowhere&mdash;I shall stay at home. And you?" said she, looking up at
      Harry Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Madame de la Tour's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the affair of half an hour&mdash;only to appear&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afterwards to the opera," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And after the opera&mdash;can't you sup here?" said Madame de Connal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the utmost pleasure&mdash;but that I am engaged to Madame de la
      Brie's ball."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," cried Madame de Connal, starting up&mdash;"I had forgot it&mdash;so
      am I this fortnight&mdash;I may as well go to the opera, too, and I can
      carry you to Madame de la Tour's&mdash;I owe her a five minutes' sitting&mdash;though
      she is un peu precieuse. And what can you find in that little cold Madame
      de la Brie&mdash;do you like ice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He like to break de ice, I suppose," said Mademoiselle. "Ma foi, you must
      then take a hatchet there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No occasion; I had rather slide upon the ice than break it. My business
      at Paris is merely, you know, to amuse myself," said he, looking at Connal&mdash;"Glissez,
      mortels, n'appuyez pas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if de ice should melt of itself," said Mademoiselle, "what would you
      do den? What would become of him, den, do you think, my dear niece?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a case which she did not like to consider&mdash;Dora blushed&mdash;no
      creature was so blind as Mademoiselle, with all her boasted quickness and
      penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time forward no more was heard of Madame de Connal's taste for
      domestic life and retirement&mdash;she seemed quite convinced, either by
      her husband, or by Mr. Ormond, or both, that no such thing was practicable
      at Paris. She had always liked le grand monde&mdash;she liked it better
      now than ever, when she found Ormond in every crowded assembly, every
      place of public amusement&mdash;a continual round of breakfasts, dinners,
      balls&mdash;court balls&mdash;bal masqu&mdash;bal de l'opera&mdash;plays&mdash;grand
      entertainments&mdash;petits soupers&mdash;ftes at Versailles&mdash;pleasure
      in every possible form and variety of luxury and extravagance succeeded
      day after day, and night after night&mdash;and Ormond, le bel Irlandois,
      once in fashion, was every where, and every where admired; flattered by
      the women, who wished to draw him in to be their partners at play&mdash;still
      more flattered by those who wished to engage him as a lover&mdash;most of
      all flattered by Dora. He felt his danger. Improved in coquetry by
      Parisian practice and power, Dora tried her utmost skill&mdash;she played
      off with great dexterity her various admirers to excite his jealousy: the
      Marquis de Beaulieu, the witty marquis, and the Count de Belle Chasse, the
      irresistible count, were dangerous rivals. She succeeded in exciting
      Ormond's jealousy; but in his noble mind there were strong opposing
      principles to withstand his selfish gratification. It was surprising with
      what politeness to each other, with how little love, all the suitors
      carried on this game of gallantry and competition of vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till Ormond appeared, it had been the general opinion that before the end
      of the winter or the spring, the Count de Belle Chasse would be
      triumphant. Why Ormond did not enter the lists, when there appeared to all
      the judges such a chance of his winning the prize, seemed incomprehensible
      to the spectators, and still more to the rival candidates. Some settled it
      with the exclamation "Inou!" Others pronounced that it was English
      bizarrerie. Every thing seemed to smooth the slippery path of temptation&mdash;the
      indifference of her husband&mdash;the imprudence&mdash;of her aunt, and
      the sophistry of Madame de Clairville&mdash;the general customs of French
      society&mdash;the peculiar profligacy of the society into which he
      happened to be thrown&mdash;the opinion which he saw prevailed, that if he
      withdrew from the competition a rival would immediately profit by his
      forbearance, conspired to weaken his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many accidental circumstances concurred to increase the danger. At these
      balls, to which he went originally to avoid Dora in smaller parties,
      Madame de Connal, though she constantly appeared, seldom danced. She did
      not dance well enough to bear comparison with French dancers; Ormond was
      in the same situation. The dancing which was very well in England would
      not do in Paris&mdash;no late lessons could, by any art, bring them to an
      equality with French nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, il ne danse pas!&mdash;He dances like an Englishman." At the first
      ball this comforted the suitors, and most the Comte de Belle Chasse; but
      this very circumstance drew Ormond and Dora closer together&mdash;she
      pretended headaches, and languor, and lassitude, and, in short, sat still.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not to be expected that the Comte de Belle Chasse could give up
      dancing: the Comte de Belle Chasse danced like le dieu de la danse,
      another Vestris; he danced every night, and Ormond sat and talked to Dora,
      for it was his duty to attend Madame when the little Abb was out of the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring was now appearing, and the spring is delightful in Paris, and
      the <i>promenades</i> in the Champs Elyses, and in the Bois de Boulogne,
      and the promenade in Long-Champ, commenced. Riding was just coming into
      high fashion with the French ladies; and, instead of riding in men's
      clothes, and like a man, it was now the ambition de monter  cheval 
      l'Angloise: to ride on a side-saddle and in an English riding habit was
      now the ambition. Now Dora, though she could not dance as well, could ride
      better than any French woman; and she was ambitious to show herself and
      her horsemanship in the Bois de Boulogne: but she had no horse that she
      liked. Le Comte de Belle Chasse offered to get one broke for her at the
      king's riding-house&mdash;this she refused: but fortunately Ormond, as was
      the custom with the English at that time, had, after his arrival, some
      English horses brought over to him at Paris. Among these was the horse he
      had once broke for Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this an English side-saddle was procured&mdash;she was properly
      equipped and mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two friends, le bel Irlandois, as they persisted in calling
      Ormond, and la belle Irlandoise, and their horses, and their horsemanship,
      were the admiration of the promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comte de Belle Chasse sent to London for an English horse at any
      price. He was out of humour&mdash;and Ormond in the finest humour
      imaginable. Dora was grateful; her horse was a beautiful, gentle-spirited
      creature: it was called Harry&mdash;it was frequently patted and caressed,
      and told how much it was valued and loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond was now in great danger, because he felt himself secure that he was
      only a friend&mdash;<i>l'ami de la maison</i>.

      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a picture of Dagote's which was at this moment an object of
      fashionable curiosity in Paris. It was a representation of one of the many
      charitable actions of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette, "then Dauphiness&mdash;at
      that time full of life, and splendour, and joy, adorning and cheering the
      elevated sphere she just began to move in;" and yet diffusing life, and
      hope, and joy, in that lower sphere, to which the radiance of the great
      and happy seldom reaches. The Dauphiness was at that time the pride of
      France, and the darling of Paris; not only worshipped by the court, but
      loved by the people. While she was Dauphiness, and during the commencement
      of her reign, every thing, even disastrous accidents, and the rigour of
      the season, served to give her fresh opportunity of winning the affection
      and exciting the enthusiasm of the people. When, during the festivities on
      her marriage, hundreds were crushed to death by the fall of a temporary
      building, the sensibility of the Dauphiness, the eagerness with which she
      sent all her money to the lieutenant de police for the families of those
      who had perished, conciliated the people, and turned even the evil presage
      to good. Again, during a severe frost, her munificence to the suffering
      poor excited such gratitude, that the people erected to her honour a vast
      pyramid of snow&mdash;Frail memorial!&mdash;"These marks of respect were
      almost as transitory as the snowy pyramid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond went with Mademoiselle O'Faley one morning to see the picture of
      the Dauphiness; and he had now an opportunity of seeing a display of
      French sensibility, that eagerness to feel and to excite <i>a sensation</i>;
      that desire to <i>produce an effect</i>, to have a scene; that half real,
      half theatric enthusiasm, by which the French character is peculiarly
      distinguished from the English. He was perfectly astonished by the
      quantity of exclamations he heard at the sight of this picture; the
      lifting up of hands and eyes, the transports, the ecstasies, the tears&mdash;the
      actual tears that he saw streaming in despite of rouge. It was real! and
      it was not real feeling! Of one thing he was clear&mdash;that this
      superfluity of feeling or exaggeration of expression completely silenced
      him, and made him cold indeed: like one unskilled or dumb he seemed to
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you of marble?" cried Mademoiselle&mdash;"where is your
      sensibilit then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it is safe at the bottom of my heart," said Ormond; "but when it
      is called for, I cannot always find it&mdash;especially on these public
      occasions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! but what good all the sensibilit in the world do at the bottom of
      your heart, where nobody see it? It is on these public occasions too, you
      must always contrive and find it quick at Paris, or after all you will
      seem but an Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be content to seem and to be what I am," said Ormond, in a tone of
      playful but determined resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bon!" said a voice near him. Mademoiselle went off in impatience to find
      some better auditor&mdash;she did not hear the "<i>Bon</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond turned, and saw near him a gentleman, whom he had often met at some
      of the first houses in Paris&mdash;the Abb Morellet, then respected as
      the most <i>reasonable</i> of all the wits of France, and who has since,
      through all the trying scenes of the revolution, through the varieties of
      unprincipled change, preserved unaltered the integrity and frankness of
      his character; retaining even to his eighty-seventh year all his
      characteristic warmth of heart and clearness of understanding&mdash;<i>le
      doyen de la littrature Franoise</i>&mdash;the love, respect, and
      admiration, of every honest heart in France. May he live to receive among
      all the other tributes, which his countrymen pay publicly and privately to
      his merit, this record of the impression his kindness left on grateful
      English hearts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young hero had often desired to be acquainted with the Abb; but the
      Abb had really hitherto passed him over as a mere young man of fashion, a
      mere Milord Anglois, one of the ephemeral race, who appear in Parisian
      society, vanish, and leave no trace behind. But now he did him the honour
      to enter into conversation with him. The Abb peculiarly disliked all
      affectation of sentiment and exaggeration: they were revolting to his good
      sense, good taste, and feeling. Ormond won directly his good opinion and
      good-will, by having insisted upon it to Mademoiselle, that he would not
      for the sake of fashion or effect pretend to feel more than he really did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" said the Abb, "hear all those women now and all those men&mdash;they
      do not know what they are saying&mdash;they make me sick. And, besides, I
      am afraid these flattering courtiers will do no good to our young
      Dauphiness, on whom so much of the future happiness or misery of France
      will depend. Her heart is excellent, and they tell me she announces a
      strong character; but what head of a young beauty and a young Queen will
      be able to withstand perpetual flattery? They will lead her wrong, and
      then will be the first to desert her&mdash;trust me, I know Paris. All
      this might change as quickly as the turn of a weathercock; but I will not
      trouble you with forebodings perhaps never to be realized. You see Paris,
      Monsieur, at a fortunate time," continued he; "society is now more
      agreeable, has more freedom, more life and variety, than at any other
      period that I can remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond replied by a just compliment to the men of letters, who at this
      period added so much to the brilliancy and pleasure of Parisian society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have seen nothing of our men of literature, have you?" said the
      Abb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much less than I wish. I meet them frequently in society, but as,
      unluckily, I have no pretensions to their notice, I can only catch a
      little of their conversation, when I am fortunate enough to be near them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the Abb, with his peculiar look and tone of good-natured
      irony, "between the pretty things you are saying and hearing from&mdash;Fear
      nothing, I am not going to name any <i>one</i>, but&mdash;every pretty
      woman in company. I grant you it must be difficult to hear reason in such
      a situation&mdash;as difficult almost as in the midst of the din of all
      the passions at the faro-table. I observe, however, that you play with
      astonishing coolness&mdash;there is something still&mdash;wanting. Excuse
      me&mdash;but you interest me, monsieur; the determination not to play at
      all&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond a certain sum I have resolved never to play," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! but the appetite grows&mdash;l'appetit vient en mangeant&mdash;the
      danger is in acquiring the taste&mdash;excuse me if I speak too freely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all&mdash;you cannot oblige me more. But there is no danger of my
      acquiring a taste for play, because I am determined to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bon!" said the Abb; "that is the most singular determination I ever
      heard: explain that to me, then, Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have determined to lose a certain sum&mdash;suppose five hundred
      guineas. I have won and lost backwards and forwards, and have been longer
      about it than you would conceive to be probable; but it is not lost yet.
      The moment it is, I shall stop short. By this means I have acquired all
      the advantages of yielding to the fashionable madness, without risking my
      future happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abb was pleased with the idea, and with the frankness and firmness of
      our young hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Monsieur," said he, "you must have a strong head&mdash;you, le
      bel Irlandois&mdash;to have prevented it from being turned with all the
      flattery you have received in Paris. There is nothing which gets into the
      head&mdash;worse still, into the heart,&mdash;so soon, so dangerously, as
      the flattery of pretty women. And yet I declare you seem wonderfully
      sober, considering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ne jurez pas," said Ormond; "but at least in one respect I have not quite
      lost my senses; I know the value and feel the want of a safe, good guide
      in Paris: if I dared to ask such a favour, I should, since he has
      expressed some interest for me, beg to be permitted to cultivate the
      acquaintance of M. l'Abb Morellet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah a&mdash;now my head will turn, for no head can stand the dose of
      flattery that happens to suit the taste. I am particularly flattered by
      the idea of being a safe, good friend; and frankly, if I can be of any
      service to you, I will. Is there any thing I can do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond thanked him, and told him that it was his great ambition to become
      acquainted with the celebrated men of literature in Paris&mdash;he said he
      should feel extremely obliged if M. Morellet would take occasion to
      introduce him to any of them they might meet in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must do better for you," said the abb&mdash;"we must show you our men
      of letters." He concluded by begging Ormond to name a day when he could do
      him the honour to breakfast with him. "I will promise you Marmontel, at
      least; for he is just going to be married to my niece, and of him we shall
      be secure: as to the rest I will promise nothing, but do as much as I
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of letters about this period in Paris, as the Abb explained to
      Ormond, began to feel their own power and consequence, and had assumed a
      tone of independence, as yet tempered with due respect for rank. Many of
      them lived or were connected with men of rank, by places about the court,
      by secretaryships and pensions, obtained through court influence. Some
      were attached by early friendship to certain great families; had
      apartments to themselves in their hotels, where they received what friends
      they pleased; and, in short, lived as if they were at home. Their company
      was much sought for by the great; and they enjoyed good houses, good
      tables, carriages, all the conveniences of life, and all the luxuries of
      the rich, without the trouble of an establishment. Their mornings were
      their own, usually employed in study; and the rest of the day they gave
      themselves to society. The most agreeable period of French literary
      society was, perhaps, while this state of things lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abb Morellet's breakfast was very agreeable; and Ormond saw at his
      house what had been promised him, many of the literary men at Paris.
      Voltaire was not then in France; and Rousseau, who was always quarrelling
      with somebody, and generally with every body, could not be prevailed upon
      to go to this breakfast. Ormond was assured that he lost nothing by not
      seeing him, or by not hearing his conversation, for that it was by no
      means equal to his writings; his temper was so susceptible and wayward,
      that he was not fit for society&mdash;neither capable of enjoying, nor of
      adding to its pleasures. Ormond heard, perhaps, more of Rousseau and
      Voltaire, and learnt more of their characters, by the anecdotes that were
      related, and the bon-mots that were repeated, than he could have done if
      they had been present. There was great variety of different characters and
      talents at this breakfast; and the Abb amused himself by making his young
      friend guess who the people were, before he told their names. It was happy
      for Ormond that he was acquainted with some of their writings (this he
      owed to Lady Annaly's well-chosen present of French books). He was
      fortunate in his first guess&mdash;Marivaux's conversation was so like the
      style of his writings, so full of hair-breadth distinctions, subtle
      exceptions, and metaphysical refinement and digressions, that Ormond soon
      guessed him, and was applauded for his quickness. Marmontel he discovered,
      by his being the only man in the room who had not mentioned to him any of
      "Les Contes Moraux." But there was one person who set all his skill at
      defiance: he pronounced that he was no author&mdash;that he was l'ami de
      la maison: he was so indeed wherever he went&mdash;but he was both a man
      of literature, and a man of deep science&mdash;no less a person than the
      great D'Alembert. Ormond thought D'Alembert and Marmontel were the two
      most agreeable men in company. D'Alembert was simple, open-hearted,
      unpresuming, and cheerful in society. Far from being subject to that
      absence of mind with which profound mathematicians are sometimes
      reproached, D'Alembert was present to every thing that was going forward&mdash;every
      trifle he enjoyed with the zest of youth, and the playfulness of
      childhood. Ormond confessed that he should never have guessed that he was
      a great mathematician and profound calculator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmontel was distinguished for combining in his conversation, as in his
      character, two qualities for which there are no precise English words, <i>navet</i>
      and <i>finesse</i>. Whoever is acquainted with Marmontel's writings must
      have a perfect knowledge of what is meant by both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for our young hero that Marmontel was, at this time, no
      longer the dissipated man he had been during too great a period of his
      life. He had now returned to his early tastes for simple pleasures and
      domestic virtues&mdash;had formed that attachment which afterwards made
      the happiness of his life: he was just going to be married to the amiable
      Mdlle. Montigny, a niece of the Abb Morellet. She and her excellent
      mother lived with him; and Ormond was most agreeably surprised and touched
      at the unexpected sight of an amiable, united, happy family, when he had
      expected only a meeting of literati.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of this domestic happiness reminded him of the Annalys&mdash;brought
      the image of Florence to his mind. If she had been but sincere, how he
      should have preferred her to all he had seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      It came upon him just at the right moment. It contrasted with all the
      dissipation he had seen, and it struck him the more strongly, because it
      could not possibly have been prepared as a moral lesson to make an
      impression. He saw the real, natural course of things&mdash;he heard in a
      few hours the result of the experience of a man of great vivacity, great
      talents, who had led a life of pleasure, and who had had opportunities of
      seeing and feeling all that it could possibly afford, at the period of the
      greatest luxury and dissipation ever known in France. No evidence could be
      stronger than Marmontel's in favour of virtue and of domestic life, nor
      could any one express it with more grace and persuasive eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did Ormond infinite good. He required such a lesson at this juncture,
      and he was capable of taking it&mdash;it recalled him to his better self.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Abb seemed to see something of what in Ormond's mind, and became
      still more interested about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, a," said he to Marmontel, as soon as Ormond was gone, "that young
      man is worth something: I thought he was only <i>le bel Irlandois</i>, but
      I find he is much more. We must do what we can for him, and not let him
      leave Paris, as so many do, having seen only the worst part of our
      society."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marmontel, who had also been pleased with him, was willing, he said, to do
      any thing in his power; but he could scarcely hope that they had the means
      of withdrawing from the double attraction of the faro-table and coquetry,
      a young man of that age and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing, or rather hope every thing," said the Abb: "his head and
      his heart are more in our favour, trust me, than his age and his figure
      are against us. To begin, my good Marmontel, did not you see how much he
      was struck and <i>edified</i> by your reformation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! if there was another Mdlle. de Montigny for him, I should fear
      nothing, or rather hope every thing," said Marmontel "but where shall he
      find such another in all Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his own country, perhaps, all in good time," said the Abb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his own country?&mdash;True," cried Marmontel, "now you recall it to
      my mind, how eager he grew in disputing with Marivaux upon the distinction
      between <i>aimable</i> and <i>amiable</i>. His description of an <i>amiable
      woman</i>, according to the English taste, was, I recollect, made <i>con
      amore</i>; and there was a sigh at the close which came from the heart,
      and which showed the heart was in England or Ireland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherever his heart is, <i>c'est bien plac</i>," said the Abb. "I like
      him&mdash;we must get him into good company&mdash;he is worthy to be
      acquainted with your amiable and <i>aimable</i> Madame de Beauveau and
      Madame de Seran."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Marmontel; "and for the honour of Paris, we must convince him
      that he has taken up false notions, and that there is such a thing as
      conjugal fidelity and domestic happiness here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bon. That is peculiarly incumbent on the author of <i>Les Contes Moraux</i>,"
      said the Abb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, fortunately for our hero, that Madame de Connal was, about
      this time, engaged to pass a fortnight at the country house of Madame de
      Clairville. During her absence, the good Abb had time to put in execution
      all his benevolent intentions, and introduced his young friend to some of
      the really good company of Paris. He pointed out to him at Madame
      Geoffrin's, Madame de Tencin's, Madame du Detfand's, and Madame
      Trudaine's, the difference between the society at the house of a rich
      farmer general&mdash;or at the house of one connected with the court, and
      with people in place and political power&mdash;and the society of mixed
      rank and literature. The mere passing pictures of these things, to one who
      was not to live in Paris, might not, perhaps, except as a matter of
      curiosity, be of much value; but his judicious friend led Ormond from
      these to make comparisons and deductions which were of use to him all his
      life afterwards.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning when Ormond awoke, the first thing he heard was, that a <i>person</i>
      from Ireland was below, who was very impatient to see him. It was
      Patrickson, Sir Ulick O'Shane's confidential man of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What news from Castle Hermitage?" cried Ormond, starting up in his bed,
      surprised at the sight of Patrickson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best that can be&mdash;never saw Sir Ulick in such heart&mdash;he has
      a share of the loan, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what news of the Annalys?" interrupted Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about them at all, sir," said Patrickson, who was a
      methodical man of business, and whose head was always intent upon what he
      called the main chance. "I have been in Dublin, and heard no country
      news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But have you no letter for me? and what brings you over so suddenly to
      Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a letter for you somewhere here, sir&mdash;only I have so many
      'tis hard to find," said Patrickson, looking carefully over a parcel of
      letters in his pocket-book, but with such a drawling slowness of manner as
      put Ormond quite out of patience. Patrickson laid the letters on the bed
      one by one. "That's not it&mdash;and that's not it; that's for Monsieur un
      tel, marchand, rue &mdash;&mdash;; that packet's from the Hamburgh
      merchants&mdash;What brings me over?&mdash;Why, sir, I have business
      enough, Heaven knows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrickson was employed not only by Sir Ulick O'Shane, but by many Dublin
      merchants and bankers, to settle business for them with different houses
      on the continent. Ormond, without listening to the various digressions he
      made concerning the persons of mercantile consequence to whom the letters
      were addressed, or from whom they were answers, pounced upon the letter in
      Sir Ulick's handwriting directed to himself, and tore it open eagerly, to
      see if there was any news of the Annalys. None&mdash;they were in
      Devonshire. The letter was merely a few lines on business&mdash;Sir Ulick
      had now the opportunity he had foreseen of laying out Ormond's money in
      the loan most advantageously for him; but there had been an omission in
      the drawing up of his power of attorney, which had been done in such a
      hurry on Ormond's leaving home. It gave power only to sell out of the
      Three per Cents.; whereas much of Ormond's money was in the Four per
      Cents. Another power, Patrickson said, was necessary, and he had brought
      one for him to sign. Patrickson in his slow manner descanted upon the
      folly of signing papers in a hurry, just when people were getting into
      carriages, which was always the way with young gentlemen, he said. He took
      care that Ormond should do nothing in a hurry now; for he put on his
      spectacles, and read the power, sparing him not a syllable of the law
      forms and repetitions. Ormond wrote a few kind lines to Sir Ulick, and
      earnestly besought him to find out something more about the Annalys. If
      Miss Annaly were married, it must have appeared in the papers. What
      delayed the marriage? Was Colonel Albemarle dismissed or accepted?&mdash;Where
      was he?&mdash;Ormond said he would be content if Sir Ulick could obtain an
      answer to that single plain question.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time Ormond was writing, Patrickson never stirred his forefinger
      from the spot where the signature was to be written at the bottom of the
      power of attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," said Ormond, looking up from the paper he going to sign, "pray,
      Patrickson, are you really and truly an Irishman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the father's side, I apprehend, sir&mdash;but my mother was English.
      Stay, sir, if you please&mdash;I must witness it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Witness away," said Ormond; and after having signed this paper,
      empowering Sir Ulick to sell 30,000<i>l</i>. out of the Four per cents.,
      Ormond lay down, and wishing him a good journey, settled himself to sleep;
      while Patrickson, packing up his papers, deliberately said, "He hoped to
      be in London <i>in short</i>; but that he should go by Havre de Grace, and
      that he should be happy to execute any commands for Mr. Ormond there or in
      Dublin." More he would have said, but finding Ormond by this time past
      reply, he left the room on tiptoe. The next morning Madame de Connal
      returned from the country, and sent Ormond word that she should expect him
      at her assembly that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every body complimented Madame de Connal upon the improvement which the
      country air had made in her beauty&mdash;even her husband was struck with
      it, and paid her his compliments on the occasion; but she stood conversing
      so long with Ormond, that the faro-players grew impatient: she led him to
      the table, but evidently had little interest herself in the game. He
      played at first with more than his usual success, but late at night his
      fortune suddenly changed; he lost&mdash;lost&mdash;till at last he
      stopped, and rising from table, said he had no more money, and he could
      play no longer. Connal, who was not one of the players, but merely looking
      on, offered to lend him any sum he pleased. "Here's a rouleau&mdash;here
      are two rouleaus&mdash;what will you have?" said Connal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond declined playing any more: he said that he had lost the sum he had
      resolved to lose, and there he would stop. Connal did not urge him, but
      laughing said, that a resolution to <i>lose</i> at play was the most
      extraordinary he had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you see I have kept it," said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I hope you will next make a resolution to win," said Connal, "and no
      doubt you will keep that as well&mdash;I prophesy that you will; and you
      will give fortune fair play to-morrow night." Ormond simply repeated that
      he should play no more. Madame de Connal soon afterwards rose from the
      table, and went to talk to Mr. Ormond. She said she was concerned for his
      loss at play this night. He answered, as he felt, that it was a matter of
      no consequence to him&mdash;that he had done exactly what he had
      determined; that in the course of the whole time he had been losing this
      money he had had a great deal of amusement in society, had seen a vast
      deal of human nature and manners, which he could not otherwise have seen,
      and that he thought his money exceedingly well employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you shall not lose your money," said Dora; "when next you play it
      shall be on my account as well as your own&mdash;you know this is not only
      a compliment, but a solid advantage. The bank has certain advantages&mdash;and
      it is fair that you should share them. I must explain to you," continued
      Madame de Connal&mdash;"they are all busy about their own affairs, and we
      may speak in English at our ease&mdash;I must explain to you, that a good
      portion of my fortune has been settled, so as to be at my own disposal&mdash;my
      aunt, you know, has also a good fortune&mdash;we are partners, and put a
      considerable sum into the faro bank. We find it answers well. You see how
      handsomely we live. M. de Connal has his own share. We have nothing to do
      with <i>that</i>. If you would take my advice," continued she, speaking in
      a very persuasive tone, "instead of forswearing play, as you seem inclined
      to do at the first reverse of fortune, you would join forces with us; you
      cannot imagine that <i>I</i> would advise you to any thing which I was not
      persuaded would be advantageous to you&mdash;you little know how much I am
      interested." She checked herself, blushed, hesitated, and hurried on&mdash;"you
      have no ties in Ireland&mdash;you seem to like Paris&mdash;where can you
      spend your time more agreeably?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More agreeably&mdash;nowhere upon earth!" cried Ormond. Her manner, tone,
      and look, at this moment were so flattering, so bewitching, that he was
      scarcely master of himself. They went to the boudoir&mdash;the company had
      risen from the faro-table, and, one after another, had most of them
      departed. Connal was gone&mdash;only a few remained in a distant
      apartment, listening to some music. It was late. Ormond had never till
      this evening stayed later than the generality of the company, but he had
      now an excuse to himself, something that he had long wished to have an
      opportunity of saying to Dora, when she should be quite alone; it was a
      word of advice about le Comte de Belle Chasse&mdash;her intimacy with him
      was beginning to be talked of. She had been invited to a bal par at the
      Spanish ambassador's for the ensuing night&mdash;but she had more
      inclination to go to a bal masqu, as Ormond had heard her declare. Now
      certain persons had whispered that it was to meet the Comte de Belle
      Chasse that she intended to go to this ball; and Ormond feared that such
      whispers might be injurious to her reputation. It was difficult to him to
      speak, because the counsels of the friend might be mistaken for the
      jealous fears of a lover. With some embarrassment he delicately, timidly,
      hinted his apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora, though naturally of a temper apt to take alarm at the touch of
      blame, and offence at the tone of advice, now in the most graceful manner
      thanked her friend for his counsel; said she was flattered, gratified, by
      the interest it showed in her happiness&mdash;and she immediately yielded
      her will, her <i>fantaisie</i>, to his better judgment. This compliance,
      and the look with which it was accompanied, convinced him of the absolute
      power he possessed over her heart. He was enchanted with Dora&mdash;she
      never looked so beautiful; never before, not even in the first days of his
      early youth, had he felt her beauty so attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Madame de Connal, dear Dora!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call me Dora," said she: "I wish ever to be Dora to Harry Ormond. Oh!
      Harry, my first, my best, my only friend, I have enjoyed but little real
      happiness since we parted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears filled her fine eyes&mdash;no longer knowing where he was, Harry
      Ormond found himself at her feet. But while he held and kissed in
      transport the beautiful hand, which was but feebly withdrawn, he seemed to
      be suddenly shocked by the sight of one of the rings on her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wedding-ring," said Dora, with a sigh. "Unfortunate marriage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not the ring on which Ormond's eyes were fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dora, whose gray hair is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father's," said Dora, in a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father!" cried Ormond, starting up. The full recollection of that
      fond father, that generous benefactor, that confiding friend, rushed upon
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is this the return I make!&mdash;Oh, if he could see us at this
      instant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if he could," cried Dora, "oh! how he would admire and love you,
      Ormond, and how he would&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice failed, and with a sudden motion she hid her face with both her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would see you, Dora, without a guide, protector, or friend; surrounded
      with admirers, among profligate men, and women still more profligate, yet
      he would see that you have preserved a reputation of which your father
      would be proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father! oh, my poor father!" cried Dora: "Oh! generous, dear, ever
      generous Ormond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bursting into tears&mdash;alternate passions seizing her&mdash;at one
      moment the thoughts of her father, the next of her lover, possessed her
      imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the noise of some one approaching recalled them both to
      their senses. They were found in earnest conversation about a party of
      pleasure that was to be arranged for the next day. Madame de Connal made
      Ormond promise that he would come the next morning, and settle every thing
      with M. de Connal for their intended expedition into the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, as Ormond was returning to Madame de Connal's, with the firm
      intention of adhering to the honourable line of conduct he had traced out
      for himself, just as he was crossing the Pont Neuf, some one ran full
      against him. Surprised at what happens so seldom in the streets of Paris,
      where all meet, pass, or cross, in crowds with magical celerity and
      address, he looked back, and at the same instant the person who had passed
      looked back also. An apparition in broad daylight could not have surprised
      Ormond more than the sight of this person. "Could it be&mdash;could it
      possibly be Moriarty Carroll, on the Pont Neuf in Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the blessing, then, it's the man himself&mdash;Master Harry!&mdash;though
      I didn't know him through the French disguise. Oh! master, then, I've been
      tried and cast, and all but hanged&mdash;sentenced to Botany&mdash;transported
      any way&mdash;for a robbery I didn't commit&mdash;since I saw you last.
      But your honour's uneasy, and it's not proper, I know, to be stopping a
      jantleman in the street; but I have a word to say that will bear no delay,
      not a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's surprise and curiosity increased&mdash;he desired Moriarty to
      follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, Moriarty, what is it you have to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a long story, then, please your honour. I was transported to
      Botany, though innocent. But first and foremost for what consarns your
      honour first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "First," said Ormond, "if you were transported, how came you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I was not transported, plase your honour&mdash;only sentenced&mdash;for
      I escaped from Kilmainham, where I was sent to be put on board the tender;
      but I got on board of an American ship, by the help of a friend&mdash;and
      this ship being knocked against the rocks, I came safe ashore in this
      country on one of the <i>sticks</i> of the vessel: so when I knowed it was
      France I was in, and recollected Miss Dora that was married in Paris, I
      thought if I could just make my way any hows to Paris, she'd befriend me
      in case of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dear master," said Moriarty, interrupting, "it's a folly to talk&mdash;I'll
      not tell you a word more of myself till you hear the news I have for you.
      The worst news I have to tell you is, there is great fear of the breaking
      of Sir Ulick's bank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The breaking of Sir Ulick's bank? I heard from him the day before
      yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May be you did; but the captain of the American ship in which I came was
      complaining of his having been kept two hours at that bank, where they
      were paying large sums in small notes, and where there was the greatest
      run upon the house that ever was seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond instantly saw his danger&mdash;he recollected the power of attorney
      he had signed two days before. But Patrickson was to go by Havre de Grace&mdash;that
      would delay him. It was possible that Ormond by setting out instantly
      might get to London time enough to save his property. He went directly and
      ordered post horses. He had no debts in Paris, nothing to pay, but for his
      stables and lodging. He had a faithful servant, whom he could leave
      behind, to make all necessary arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, jewel, to be in a hurry," said Carroll. "But sure you
      won't leave poor Moriarty behind ye here in distress, when he has no
      friend in the wide world but yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, in the first place, Moriarty, are you innocent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my conscience, master, I am perfectly innocent as the child unborn,
      both of the murder and the robbery. If your honour will give me leave,
      I'll tell you the whole story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be a long affair, Moriarty, <i>if you talk out of the face</i>,
      as you used to do. I will, however, find an opportunity to hear it all.
      But, in the meantime, stay where you are till I return."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond went instantly to Connal's, to inform him of what had happened. His
      astonishment was obviously mixed with disappointment. But to do him
      justice, besides the interest which he really had in the preservation of
      the fortune, he felt some personal regard for Ormond himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall we do without you?" said he. "I assure you, Madame and I have
      never been so happy together since the first month after our marriage as
      we have been since you came to Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal was somewhat consoled by hearing Ormond say, that if he were time
      enough in London to save his fortune, he proposed returning immediately to
      Paris, intending to make the tour of Switzerland and Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connal had no doubt that they should yet be able to fix him at Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Connal and Mademoiselle were out&mdash;Connal did not know where
      they were gone. Ormond was glad to tear himself away with as few adieus as
      possible. He got into his travelling carriage, put his servant on the box,
      and took Moriarty with him in the carriage, that he might relate his
      history at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plase your honour," said Moriarty, "Mr. Marcus never missed any
      opportunity of showing me ill-will. The supercargo of the ship that was
      cast away, when you were with Sir Herbert Annaly, God rest his soul! came
      down to the sea-side to look for some of the things that he had lost: the
      day after he came, early in the morning, his horse, and bridle, and
      saddle, and a surtout coat, was found in a lane, near the place where we
      lived, and the supercargo was never heard any more of. Suspicion fell upon
      many&mdash;the country rung with the noise that was made about this murder&mdash;and
      at last I was taken up for it, because people had seen me buy cattle at
      the fair, and the people would not believe it was with money your honour
      sent me by the good parson&mdash;for the parson was gone out of the
      country, and I had nobody to stand my friend; for Mr. Marcus was on the
      grand jury, and the sheriff was his friend, and Sir Ulick was in Dublin,
      at the bank. Howsomdever, after a long trial, which lasted the whole day,
      a 'cute lawyer on my side found out that there was no proof that any body
      had been murdered, and that a man might lose his horse, his saddle, and
      his bridle, and his big coat, without being kilt: so that the judge
      ordered the jury to let me off for the murder. They then tried me for the
      robbery; and sure enough that went again me: for a pair of silver-mounted
      pistols, with the man's name engraved upon them, was found in my house.
      They knew the man's name by the letters in the big coat. The judge asked
      me what I had to say for myself: 'My lard,' says I, 'those pistols were
      brought into my house about a fortnight ago, by a little boy, one little
      Tommy Dunshaughlin, who found them in a punk-horn, at the edge of a
      bog-hole.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The jidge favoured me more than the jury&mdash;for he asked how old the
      boy was, and whether I could produce him? The little fellow was brought
      into court, and it was surprising how clear he told his story. The jidge
      listened to the child, young as he was. But M'Crule was on the jury, and
      said that he knew the child to be as cunning as any in Ireland, and that
      he would not believe a word that came out of his mouth. So the short and
      the long of it was, I was condemned to be transported.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have done you good, if you'd heard the cry in the court when
      sentence was given, for I was loved in the country. Poor Peggy and
      Sheelah!&mdash;But I'll not be troubling your honour's tender heart with
      our parting. I was transmuted to Dublin, to be put on board the tender,
      and lodged in Kilmainham, waiting for the ship that was to go to Botany. I
      had not been long there, when another prisoner was brought to the same
      room with me. He was a handsome-looking man, about thirty years of age, of
      the most penetrating eye and determined countenance that I ever saw. He
      appeared to be worn down with ill-health, and his limbs much swelled:
      notwithstanding which, he had strong handcuffs on his wrists, and he
      seemed to be guarded with uncommon care. He begged the turnkey to lay him
      down upon the miserable iron bed that was in the cell; and he begged him,
      for God's sake, to let him have a jug of water by his bedside, and to
      leave him to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not help pitying this poor cratur; I went to him, and offered him
      any assistance in my power. He answered me shortly, 'What are you here
      for?'&mdash;I told him. 'Well,' says he, 'whether you are guilty or not,
      is your affair, not mine; but answer me at once&mdash;are you a <i>good
      man</i>?&mdash;Can you go through with a thing?&mdash;and are you steel to
      the back-bone?'&mdash;'I am,' said I. 'Then,' said he, 'you are a lucky
      man&mdash;for he that is talking to you is Michael Dunne, who knows how to
      make his way out of any jail in Ireland.' Saying this, he sprung with
      great activity from the bed. 'It is my cue,' said he, 'to be sick and
      weak, whenever the turnkey comes in, to put him off his guard&mdash;for
      they have all orders to watch me strictly; because as how, do you see, I
      broke out of the jail of Trim; and when they catched me, they took me
      before his honour the police magistrate, who did all he could to get out
      of me the way which I made my escape.' 'Well,' says the magistrate, 'I'll
      put you in a place where you can't get out&mdash;till you're sent to
      'Botany.' 'Plase your worship,' says I, 'if there's no offence in saying
      it, there's no such place in Ireland.'&mdash;'No such place as what?' 'No
      such place as will hold Michael Dunne.'&mdash;'What do you think of
      Kilmainbam?' says he. 'I think it's a fine jail&mdash;and it will be no
      asy matter to get out of it&mdash;but it is not impossible.'&mdash;'Well,
      Mr. Dunne,' said the magistrate, 'I have heard of your fame, and that you
      have secrets of your own for getting out. Now, if you'll tell me how you
      got out of the jail of Trim, I'll make your confinement at Kilmainham as
      asy as may be, so as to keep you safe; and if you do not, you must be
      ironed, and I will have sentinels from an English regiment, who shall be
      continually changed: so that you can't get any of them to help you.'&mdash;'Plase
      your worship,' said Dunne, 'that's very hard usage; but I know as how that
      you are going to build new jails all over Ireland, and that you'd be glad
      to know the best way to make them secure. If your worship will promise me
      that if I get out of Kilmainham, and if I tell you how I do it, then
      you'll get me a free pardon, I'll try hard but what before three months
      are over I'll be a prisoner at large.'&mdash;'That's more than I can
      promise you,' said the magistrate; 'but if you will disclose to me the
      best means of keeping other people in, I will endeavour to keep you from
      Botany Bay.'&mdash;'Now, sir,' says Dunne, 'I know your worship to be a
      man of honour, and that your own honour regards yourself, and not me; so
      that if I was ten times as bad as I am, you'd keep your promise with me,
      as well as if I was the best gentleman in Ireland. So that now, Mr.
      Moriarty,' said Dunne, 'do you see, if I get out, I shall be safe; and if
      you get out along with me, you have nothing to do but to go over to
      America. And if you are a married man, and tired of your wife, you'll get
      rid of her. If you are not tired of her, and you have any substance, she
      may sell it and follow you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was something, Master Harry, about the man that made me have great
      confidence in him&mdash;and I was ready to follow his advice. Whenever the
      turnkey was coming he was groaning and moaning on the bed. At other times
      he made me keep bathing his wrists with cold water, so that in three or
      four days they were not half the size they were at first. This change he
      kept carefully from the jailor. I observed that he frequently asked what
      day of the month it was, but that he never made any attempt to speak to
      the sentinels; nor did he seem to make any preparation, or to lay any
      scheme for getting out. I held my tongue, and waited qui'tely. At last, he
      took out of his pocket a little flageolet, and began to play upon it. He
      asked me if I could play: I said I could a little, but very badly. 'I
      don't care how bad it is, if you can play at all.' He got off the bed
      where he was lying, and with the utmost ease pulled his hands out of his
      handcuffs. Besides the swelling of his wrists having gone down, he had
      some method of getting rid of his thumb that I never could understand.
      Says I, 'Mr. Dunne, the jailor will miss the fetters,'&mdash;'No,' said
      he, 'for I will put them on again;' and so he did, with great ease. 'Now,'
      said he, 'it is time to begin our work.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He took off one of his shoes, and taking out the in-sole, he showed me a
      hole, that was cut where the heel was, in which there was a little small
      flat bottle, which he told me was the most precious thing in life. And
      under the rest of the sole there were a number of saws, made of watch
      spring, that lay quite flat and snug under his foot. The next time the
      turnkey came in, he begged, for the love of God, to have a pipe and some
      tobacco, which was accordingly granted to him. What the pipes and tobacco
      were for, I could not then guess, but they were found to be useful. He now
      made a paste of some of the bread of his allowance, with which he made a
      cup round the bottom of one of the bars of the window; into this cup he
      poured some of the contents of the little bottle, which was, I believe,
      oil of vitriol: in a little time, this made a bad smell, and it was then I
      found the use of the pipe and tobacco, for the smell of the tobacco quite
      bothered the smell of the vitriol. When he thought he had softened the
      iron bar sufficiently, he began to work away with the saws, and he soon
      taught me how to use them; so that we kept working on continually, no
      matter how little we did at a time; but as we were constantly at it, what
      I thought never could be done was finished in three or four days. The use
      of the flageolet was to drown the noise of the filing; for when one filed,
      the other piped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the bar was cut through, he fitted the parts nicely together, and
      covered them over with rust. He proceeded in the same manner to cut out
      another bar; so that we had a free opening out of the window. Our cell was
      at the very top of the jail, so that even to look down to the ground was
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under various pretences, we had got an unusual quantity of blankets on
      our beds; these he examined with the utmost care, as upon their strength
      our lives were to depend. We calculated with great coolness the breadth of
      the strips into which he might cut the blankets, so as to reach from the
      window to the ground; allowing for the knots by which they were to be
      joined, and for other knots that were to hinder the hands and feet from
      slipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now,' said he, 'Mr. Moriarty, all this is quite asy, and requires
      nothing but a determined heart and a sound head: but the difficulty is to
      baffle the sentinel that is below, and who is walking backward and forward
      continually, day and night, under the window; and there is another, you
      see, in a sentry-box, at the door of the yard: and, for all I know, there
      may be another sentinel at the other side of the wall. Now these men are
      never twice on the same duty: I have friends enough out of doors, who have
      money enough, and would have talked reason to them; but as these sentinels
      are changed every day, no good can be got of <i>them</i>: but stay till
      to-morrow night, and we'll try what we can do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was determined to follow him. The next night, the moment that we were
      locked in for the night, we set to work to cut the blankets into slips,
      and tied them together with great care. We put this rope round one of the
      fixed bars of the window; and, pulling at each knot, we satisfied
      ourselves that every part was sufficiently strong. Dunne looked frequently
      out of the window with the utmost anxiety&mdash;it was a moonlight night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The moon,' said he, 'will be down in an hour and a half.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a little while we heard the noise of several girls singing at a
      distance from the windows, and we could see, as they approached, that they
      were dancing, and making free with the sentinels: I saw that they were
      provided with bottles of spirits, with which they pledged the deluded
      soldiers. By degrees the sentinels forgot their duty; and, by the
      assistance of some laudanum contained in some of the spirits, they were
      left senseless on the ground. The whole of this plan, and the very night
      and hour, had been arranged by Dunne with his associates, before he was
      put into Kilmainham. The success of this scheme, which was totally
      unexpected by me, gave me, I suppose, plase your honour, fresh courage.
      He, very honourably, gave me the choice to go down first or to follow him.
      I was ashamed not to go first: after I had got out of the window, and had
      fairly hold of the rope, my fear diminished, and I went cautiously down to
      the bottom. Here I waited for Dunne, and we both of us silently stole
      along in the dark, for the moon had gone in, and we did not meet with the
      least obstruction. Our out of door's assistants had the prudence to get
      entirely out of sight. Dunne led me to a hiding-place in a safe part of
      the town, and committed me to the care of a seafaring man, who promised to
      get me on board an American ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As for my part,' said Dunne, 'I will go in the morning, boldly, to the
      magistrate, and claim his promise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did so&mdash;and the magistrate with good sense, and good faith, kept
      his promise, and obtained a pardon for Dunne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wrote to Peggy, to get aboard an American ship. I was cast away on the
      coast of France&mdash;made my way to the first religious house that I
      could hear of, where I luckily found an Irishman, who saved me from
      starvation, and who sent me on from convent to convent, till I got to
      Paris, where your honour met me on that bridge, just when I was looking
      for Miss Dora's house. And that's all I've got to tell," concluded
      Moriarty, "and all true."
    </p>
    <p>
      No adventures of any sort happened to our hero in the course of his
      journey. The wind was fair for England when he reached Calais: he had a
      good passage; and with all the expedition that good horses, good roads,
      good money, and civil words, ensure in England, he pursued his way; and
      arrived in the shortest time possible in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached town in the morning, before the usual hour when the banks are
      open. Leaving orders with his servant, on whose punctuality he could
      depend, to awaken him at the proper hour, he lay down, overcome with
      fatigue, and slept&mdash;yes&mdash;slept soundly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ormond was wakened at the proper hour&mdash;went immediately to &mdash;&mdash;'s
      bank. It was but just open, and beginning to do business. He had never
      been there before&mdash;his person was not known to any of the firm. He
      entered a long narrow room, so dark at the entrance from the street that
      he could at first scarcely see what was on either side of him&mdash;a
      clerk from some obscure nook, and from a desk higher than himself, put out
      his head, with a long pen behind his ear, and looked at Ormond as he came
      in. "Pray, sir, am I right?&mdash;Is this Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s bank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      With mercantile economy of words, and a motion of his head, the clerk
      pointed out to Ormond the way he should go&mdash;and continued casting up
      his books. Ormond walked down the narrow aisle, and it became light as he
      advanced towards a large window at the farther end, before which three
      clerks sat at a table opposite to him. A person stood with his back to
      Ormond, and was speaking earnestly to one of the clerks, who leaned over
      the table listening. Just as Ormond came up he heard his own name
      mentioned&mdash;he recollected the voice&mdash;he recollected the back of
      the figure&mdash;the very bottle-green coat&mdash;it was Patrickson&mdash;Ormond
      stood still behind him, and waited to hear what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the clerk, "it is a very sudden order for a very large sum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, sir&mdash;but you see my power&mdash;you know Mr. Ormond's
      handwriting, and you know Sir Ulick O'Shane's&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. James," said the principal clerk, turning to one of the others, "be
      so good to hand me the letters we have of Mr. Ormond. As we have never
      seen the gentleman sign his name, sir, it is necessary that we should be
      more particular in comparing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sir, no doubt&mdash;compare as much as you please&mdash;no doubt
      people cannot be too exact and deliberate in doing business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It certainly is his signature," said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I witnessed the paper," said Patrickson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I don't dispute it," replied the clerk; "but you cannot blame us for
      being cautious when such a <i>very</i> large sum is in question, and when
      we have no letter of advice from the gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I tell you I come straight from Mr. Ormond; I saw him last Tuesday at
      Paris&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you see him now, sir," said Ormond, advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrickson's countenance changed beyond all power of control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ormond!&mdash;I thought you were at Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Patrickson!&mdash;I thought you were at Havre de Grace&mdash;what
      brought you here so suddenly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acted for another," hesitated Patrickson: "I therefore made no delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, thank Heaven!" said Ormond, "I have acted for myself!&mdash;but just
      in time!&mdash;Sir," continued he, addressing himself to the principal
      clerk, "Gentlemen, I have to return you my thanks for your caution&mdash;it
      has actually saved me from ruin&mdash;for I understand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond suddenly stopped, recollecting that he might injure Sir Ulick
      O'Shane essentially by a premature disclosure, or by repeating a report
      which might be ill-founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned again to speak to Patrickson, but Patrickson had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then continuing to address himself to the clerks. "Gentlemen," said
      Ormond, speaking carefully, "have you heard any thing of or from Sir Ulick
      O'Shane lately, except what you may have heard from this Mr. Patrickson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not <i>from</i> but <i>of</i> Sir Ulick O'Shane we heard from our Dublin
      correspondent&mdash;in due course we have heard," replied the head clerk.
      "Too true, I am afraid, sir, that his bank had come to paying in sixpences
      on Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The second clerk seeing great concern in Ormond's countenance, added, "But
      Sunday, you know, is in their favour, sir; and Monday and Tuesday are
      holidays: so they may stand the run, and recover yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of this gentleman's thirty thousand, they might have
      recovered, perhaps&mdash;but Mr. Ormond would scarcely have recovered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the ten thousand pounds in the Three per Cents., of which Sir Ulick
      had obtained possession a month ago, that was irrecoverable, <i>if</i> his
      bank should break&mdash;"<i>If</i>."&mdash;The clerks all spoke with due
      caution; but their opinion was sufficiently plain. They were honestly
      indignant against the guardian who had thus attempted to ruin his ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though almost stunned and breathless with the sense of the danger he had
      so narrowly escaped, yet Ormond's instinct of generosity, if we may use
      the expression, and his gratitude for early kindness, operated; he <i>would</i>
      not believe that Sir Ulick had been guilty of a deliberate desire to
      injure him. At all events, he determined that, instead of returning to
      France, as he had intended, he would go immediately to Ireland, and try if
      it were possible to assist Sir Ulick, without materially injuring himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ordered horses, he made inquiry wherever he thought he might obtain
      information with respect to the Annalys. All that he could learn was, that
      they were at some sea-bathing place in the south of England, and that Miss
      Annaly was still unmarried. A ray of hope darted into the mind of our hero&mdash;and
      he began his journey to Ireland with feelings which every good and
      generous mind will know how to appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had escaped at Paris from a temptation which it was scarcely possible
      to resist. He had by decision and activity preserved his fortune from ruin&mdash;he
      had under his protection an humble friend, whom he had saved from
      banishment and disgrace, and whom he hoped to restore to his wretched wife
      and family. Forgetful of the designs that had been meditated against him
      by his guardian, to whose necessities he attributed his late conduct, he
      hastened to his immediate assistance; determined to do every thing in his
      power to save Sir Ulick from ruin, <i>if</i> his difficulties arose from
      misfortune, and not from criminality: if, on the contrary, he should find
      that Sir Ulick was fraudulently a bankrupt, he determined to quit Ireland
      immediately, and to resume his scheme of foreign travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system of posting had at this time been carried to the highest
      perfection in England. It was the amusement and the fashion of the time,
      to squander large sums in hurrying from place to place, without any
      immediate motive for arriving at the end of a journey, but that of having
      the satisfaction of boasting in what a short time it had been performed;
      or, as it is expressed in one of our comedies, "to enter London like a
      meteor, with a prodigious tail of dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty Carroll, who was perched upon the box with Ormond's servant, made
      excellent observations wherever he went. His English companion could not
      comprehend how a man of common sense could be ignorant of various things,
      which excited the wonder and curiosity of Moriarty. Afterwards, however,
      when they travelled in Ireland, Moriarty had as much reason to be
      surprised at the impression which Irish manners and customs made upon his
      companion. After a rapid journey to Holyhead, our hero found to his
      mortification that the packet had sailed with a fair wind about half an
      hour before his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his impatience, he learned that it was impossible to
      overtake the vessel in a boat, and that he must wait for the sailing of
      the next day's packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, the Lord-Lieutenant's secretary arrived from London
      at Holyhead time enough for the tide; and as he had an order from the
      post-office for a packet to sail whenever he should require it, the
      intelligent landlord of the inn suggested to Ormond that he might probably
      obtain permission from the secretary to have a berth in this packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond's manner and address were such as to obtain from the good-natured
      secretary the permission he required; and, in a short time, he found
      himself out of sight of the coast of Wales. During the beginning of their
      voyage the motion of the vessel was so steady, and the weather so fine,
      that every body remained on deck; but on the wind shifting and becoming
      more violent, the landsmen soon retired below decks, and poor Moriarty and
      his English companion slunk down into the steerage, submitting to their
      fate. Ormond was never sea-sick; he walked the deck, and enjoyed the
      admirable manoeuvring of the vessel. Two or three naval officers, and some
      other passengers, who were used to the sea, and who had quietly gone to
      bed during the beginning of the voyage, now came from below, to avoid the
      miseries of the cabin. As one of these gentlemen walked backwards and
      forwards upon deck, he eyed our hero from time to time with looks of
      anxious curiosity&mdash;Ormond perceiving this, addressed the stranger,
      and inquired from him whether he had mistaken his looks, or whether he had
      any wish to speak to him. "Sir," said the stranger, "I do think that I
      have seen you before, and I believe that I am under considerable
      obligations to you&mdash;I was supercargo to that vessel that was wrecked
      on the coast of Ireland, when you and your young friend exerted yourselves
      to save the vessel from plunder. After the shipwreck, the moment I found
      myself on land, I hastened to the neighbouring town to obtain protection
      and assistance. In the mean time, your exertions had saved a great deal of
      our property, which was lodged in safety in the neighbourhood. I had
      procured a horse in the town to which I had gone, and had ridden back to
      the shore with the utmost expedition. Along with the vessel which had been
      shipwrecked there had sailed another American sloop. We were both bound
      from New York to Bourdeaux. In the morning after the shipwreck, our
      consort hove in sight of the wreck, and sent a boat on shore, to inquire
      what had become of the crew, and of the cargo, but they found not a human
      creature on the shore, except myself. The plunderers had escaped to their
      hiding-places, and all the rest of the inhabitants had accompanied the
      poor young gentleman, who had fallen a sacrifice to his exertions in our
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was of the utmost consequence to my employers, that I should arrive as
      soon as possible at Bourdeaux, to give an account of what had happened. I
      therefore, without hesitation, abandoned my horse, with its bridle and
      saddle, and I got on board the American vessel without delay. In my hurry
      I forgot my great coat on the shore, a loss which proved extremely
      inconvenient to me&mdash;as there were papers in the pockets which might
      be necessary to produce before my employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I arrived safely at Bourdeaux, settled with my principals to their
      satisfaction, and I am now on my way to Ireland, to reclaim such part of
      my property, and that of my employers, as was saved from the savages who
      pillaged us in our distress."&mdash;This detail, which was given with
      great simplicity and precision, excited considerable interest among the
      persons upon the deck of the packet. Moriarty, who was pretty well
      recovered from his sickness, was now summoned upon deck. Ormond confronted
      him with the American supercargo, but neither of them had the least
      recollection of each other. "And yet," said Ormond to the American,
      "though you do not know this man, he is at this moment under sentence of
      transportation for having robbed you, and he very narrowly escaped being
      hanged for your murder. A fate from which he was saved by the patience and
      sagacity of the judge who tried him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moriarty's surprise was expressed with such strange contortions of
      delight, and with a tone, and in a phraseology, so peculiarly his own, as
      to astonish and entertain the spectators. Among these was the Irish
      secretary, who, without any application being made to him, promised
      Moriarty to procure for him a free pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Ormond's landing in Dublin, the first news he heard, and it was
      repeated a hundred times in a quarter of an hour, was that "Sir Ulick
      O'Shane was bankrupt&mdash;that his bank shut up yesterday." It was a
      public calamity, a source of private distress, that reached lower and
      farther than any bankruptcy had ever done in Ireland. Ormond heard of it
      from every tongue, it was written in every face&mdash;in every house it
      was the subject of lamentation, of invective. In every street, poor men,
      with ragged notes in their hands, were stopping to pore over the names at
      the back of the notes, or hurrying to and fro, looking up at the
      shop-windows for "<i>half price given here for O'Shane's notes</i>."
      Groups of people, of all ranks, gathered&mdash;stopped&mdash;dispersed,
      talking of Sir Ulick O'Shane's bankruptcy&mdash;their hopes&mdash;their
      fears&mdash;their losses&mdash;their ruin&mdash;their despair&mdash;their
      rage. Some said it was all owing to Sir Ulick's shameful extravagance:
      "His house in Dublin, fit for a duke!&mdash;Castle Hermitage full of
      company to the last week&mdash;balls&mdash;dinners&mdash;the most
      expensive luxuries&mdash;scandalous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Others accused Sir Ulick's absurd speculations. Many pronounced the
      bankruptcy to be fraudulent, and asserted that an estate had been made
      over to Marcus, who would live in affluence on the ruin of the creditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Sir Ulick's house in town every window-shutter was closed. Ormond rang
      and knocked in vain&mdash;not that he wished to see Sir Ulick&mdash;no, he
      would not have intruded on his misery for the world; but Ormond longed to
      inquire from the servants how things were with him. No servant could be
      seen. Ormond went to Sir Ulick's bank. Such crowds of people filled the
      street that it was with the utmost difficulty and after a great working of
      elbows, that in an hour or two he made his way to one of the barred
      windows. There was a place where notes were handed in and <i>accepted</i>,
      as they called it, by the clerks, who thus for the hour soothed and
      pacified the sufferers, with the hopes that this <i>acceptance</i> would
      be good, and would <i>stand in stead</i> at some future day. They were
      told that when things should come to a settlement, all would be paid.
      There was property enough to satisfy the creditors, when the <i>commissioners</i>
      should look into it. Sir Ulick would pay all honourably&mdash;as far as
      possible&mdash;fifteen shillings in the pound, or certainly ten shillings&mdash;the
      <i>accepted</i> notes would pass for that any where. The crowd pressed
      closer and closer, arms crossing over each other to get notes in at the
      window, the clerks' heads appearing and disappearing. It was said they
      were laughing while they thus deluded the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the intelligence that Ormond, after being nearly suffocated, could
      obtain from any of the clerks, was, that Sir Ulick was in the country.
      "They believed at Castle Hermitage&mdash;could not be certain&mdash;had no
      letters for him to-day&mdash;he was ill when they heard last&mdash;so ill
      he could do no business&mdash;confined to his bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The people in the street hearing these answers replied, "Confined in his
      bed, is he?&mdash;In the jail, it should be, as many will be along of him.
      Ill, is he, Sir Ulick?&mdash;Sham sickness, may be&mdash;all his life a <i>sham</i>."
      All these and innumerable other taunts and imprecations, with which the
      poor people vented their rage, Ormond heard as he made his way out of the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all who had suffered, he who had probably lost the most, and who
      certainly had been on the brink of losing the greatest part of what he
      possessed, was the only individual who uttered no reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was impatient to get down to Castle Hermitage, and if he found that Sir
      Ulick had acted fairly, to be some comfort to him, to be with him at least
      when deserted by all the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all the inns upon the road, as he went from Dublin to Castle Hermitage,
      even at the villages where he stopped to water the horses, every creature,
      down to the hostlers, were talking of the bankruptcy&mdash;and abusing Sir
      Ulick O'Shane and his son. The curses that were deep, not loud, were the
      worst&mdash;and the faces of distress worse than all. Gathering round his
      carriage, wherever it stopped, the people questioned him and his servants
      about the news, and then turned away, saying they were ruined. The men
      stood in unutterable despair. The women crying, loudly bewailed "their
      husbands, their sons, that must waste in the jail or fly the country; for
      what should they do for the rents that had been made up in Sir Ulick's
      notes, and <i>no good</i> now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond felt the more on hearing these complaints, from his sense of the
      absolute impossibility of relieving the universal distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pursued his melancholy journey, and took Moriarty into the carriage
      with him, that he might not be recognized on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came within sight of Castle Hermitage, he stopped at the top of
      the hill at a cottage, where many a time in his boyish days he had rested
      with Sir Ulick out hunting. The mistress of the house, now an old woman,
      came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Harry dear!" cried she, when she saw who it was. But the sudden
      flash of joy in her old face was over in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you hear it?" cried she, "and the great change it caused him&mdash;poor
      Sir Ulick O'Shane? I went up with eggs on purpose to see him, but could
      only hear&mdash;he was in his bed&mdash;wasting with trouble&mdash;nobody
      knows any thing more&mdash;all is kept hush and close. Mr. Marcus took off
      all he could rap, and ran, even to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, I don't want to hear of Marcus&mdash;can you tell me whether
      Dr. Cambray is come home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not expected to come till Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! not a morning but I'm there the first thing, asking, and longing for
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lie back, Moriarty, in the carriage, and pull your hat over your face,"
      whispered Ormond: "postilions, drive on to that little cabin, with the
      trees about it, at the foot of the hill." This was Moriarty's cabin. When
      they stopped, poor Peggy was called out. Alas! how altered from the
      dancing, sprightly, blooming girl, whom Ormond had known so few years
      since in the Black Islands! How different from the happy wife, whom he had
      left, comfortably settled in a cottage suited to her station and her
      wishes! She was thin, pale, and haggard&mdash;her dress was neglected&mdash;an
      ill-nursed child, that she had in her arms she gave to a young girl near
      her. Approaching the carriage, and seeing Harry Ormond, she seemed ready
      to sink into the earth: however, after having drank some water, she
      recovered sufficiently to be able to answer Ormond's inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you intend to do, Peggy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, sir!&mdash;go to America, to join my husband sure; every thing was to
      have been sold, Monday last&mdash;but nobody has any money&mdash;and I am
      tould it will cost a great deal to get across the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this she burst into tears and cried most bitterly; and at this moment
      the carriage door flew open&mdash;Moriarty's impatience could be no longer
      restrained&mdash;he flung himself into the arms of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving this happy and innocent couple to enjoy their felicity we proceed
      to Castle Hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond directed the postilions to go the back way to the house. They drove
      down the old avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they saw a boy, who seemed to be standing on the watch, run back
      towards the castle, leaping over hedge and ditch with desperate haste.
      Then came running from the house three men, calling to one another to shut
      the gates for the love of God!
    </p>
    <p>
      They all ran towards the gateway through which the postilions were going
      to drive, reached it just as the foremost horses turned, and flung the
      gate full against the horses' heads. The men, without looking or caring,
      went on locking the gate. Ormond jumped out of the carriage&mdash;at the
      sight of him, the padlock fell from the hand of the man who held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Harry himself!&mdash;and is it you?&mdash;We ask your pardon, your
      honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were three of Sir Ulick's workmen&mdash;Ormond forbad the carriage
      to follow. "For perhaps you are afraid of the noise disturbing Sir Ulick?"
      said be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, plase your honour," said the foremost man, "it will not disturb him&mdash;as
      well let the carriage come on&mdash;only," whispered he, "best to send the
      hack postilions with their horses always to the inn, afore they'd learn
      any thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond walked on quickly, and as soon as he was out of hearing of the
      postilions again asked the men, "What news?&mdash;how is Sir Ulick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor gentleman! he has had a deal of trouble&mdash;and no help for him,"
      said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better tell him plain," whispered the next. "Master Harry, Sir Ulick
      O'Shane's trouble is over in this world, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead, he is, and cold, and in his coffin&mdash;this minute&mdash;and
      thanks be to God, if he is safe there even from them that are on the watch
      to seize on his body!&mdash;In the dread of them creditors, orders were
      given to keep the gates locked. He is dead since Tuesday, sir,&mdash;but
      hardly one knows it out of the castle&mdash;except us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond walked on silently, while they followed, talking at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a very great cry against him, sir, I hear, in Dublin,&mdash;and
      here in the country, too," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The distress, they say, is very great, he caused; but they might let his
      body rest any way&mdash;what good can that do them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad or good, they sha'n't touch it," said the other: "by the blessing, we
      shall have him buried safe in the morning, afore they are stirring. We
      shall carry the coffin through the under ground passage, that goes to the
      stables, and out by the lane to the churchyard asy&mdash;and the
      gentleman, the clergyman, has notice all will be ready, and the
      housekeeper only attending."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! the pitiful funeral," said the eldest of the men, "the pitiful
      funeral for Sir Ulick O'Shane, that was born to better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we can only do the best we can," said the other, "let what will
      happen to ourselves; for Sir Marcus said he wouldn't take one of his
      father's notes from any of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond involuntarily felt for his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! don't be bothering the gentleman, don't be talking," said the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This way, Master Harry, if you please, sir, the underground way to the
      back yard. We keep all close till after the burying, for fear&mdash;that
      was the housekeeper's order. Sent all off to Dublin when Sir Ulick took to
      his bed, and Lady Norton went off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond refrained from asking any questions about his illness, fearing to
      inquire into the manner of his death. He walked on more quickly and
      silently. When they were going through the dark passage, one of the men,
      in a low voice, observed to Mr. Ormond that the housekeeper would tell him
      all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got to the house, the housekeeper and Sir Ulick's man appeared,
      seeming much surprised at the sight of Mr. Ormond. They said a great deal
      about the <i>unfortunate event</i>, and their own sorrow and <i>distress</i>;
      but Ormond saw that theirs were only the long faces, dismal tones, and
      outward show of grief. They were just a common housekeeper and gentleman's
      gentleman, neither worse nor better than ordinary servants in a great
      house. Sir Ulick had only treated them as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper, without Ormond's asking a single question, went on to
      tell him that "Castle Hermitage was as full of company, even to the last
      week, as ever it could hold, and all as grand as ever; the first people in
      Ireland&mdash;champagne and burgundy, and ices, and all as usual&mdash;and
      a ball that very week. Sir Ulick was very considerate, and sent Lady
      Norton off to her other friends; he took ill suddenly that night with a
      great pain in his head: he had been writing hard, and in great trouble,
      and he took to his bed, and never rose from it&mdash;he was found by Mr.
      Dempsey, his own man, dead in his bed in the morning&mdash;of a broken
      heart, to be sure!&mdash;Poor gentleman!&mdash;Some people in the
      neighbourhood was mighty busy talking how the coroner ought to be sent
      for; but that blew over, sir. But then we were in dread of the seizure of
      the body for debt, so the gates was kept locked; and now you know all we
      know about it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond said he would attend the funeral. There was no attempt to seize
      upon the body; only the three workmen, the servants, a very few of the
      cottagers, and Harry Ormond, attended to the grave the body of the once
      popular Sir Ulick O'Shane. This was considered by the country people as
      the greatest of all the misfortunes that had befallen him; the lowest
      degradation to which an O'Shane could be reduced. They compared him with
      King Corny, and "see the difference!" said they; "the one was <i>the true
      thing</i>, and never <i>changed</i>&mdash;and after all, where is the
      great friends now?&mdash;the quality that used to be entertained at the
      castle above? Where is all the favour promised him now? What is it come
      to? See, with all his wit, and the schemes upon schemes, broke and gone,
      and forsook and forgot, and buried without a funeral, or a tear, but from
      Master Harry." Ormond was surprised to hear, in the midst of many of their
      popular superstitions and prejudices, how justly they estimated Sir
      Ulick's abilities and character.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the men filled up his grave, one of them said, "There lies the making
      of an excellent gentleman&mdash;but the cunning of his head spoiled the
      goodness of his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the funeral an agent came from Dublin to settle Sir Ulick
      O'Shane's affairs in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On opening his desk, the first thing that appeared was a bundle of
      accounts, and a letter, directed to H. Ormond, Esq. He took it to his own
      room and read&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "ORMOND,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I intended to <i>employ</i> your money to re-establish my falling credit,
      but I never intended to <i>defraud</i> you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "ULICK O'SHANE."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both from a sense of justice to the poor people concerned, and from a
      desire to save Sir Ulick O'Shane's memory as far as it was in his power
      from reproach, Ormond determined to pay whatever small debts were due to
      his servants, workmen, and immediate dependents. For this purpose, when
      the funeral was over, he had them all assembled at Castle Hermitage. Every
      just demand of this sort was paid, all were satisfied; even the
      bare-footed kitchen-maid, the drudge of this great house, who, in despair,
      had looked at her poor one guinea note of Sir Ulick's, had that note paid
      in gold, and went away blessing Master Harry. Happy for all that he is
      come home to us, was the general feeling. But there was one man, a groom
      of Sir Ulick's, who did not join in any of these blessings or praises: he
      stood silent and motionless, with his eyes on the money which Mr. Ormond
      had put into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your money right?" said Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, sir; but I had something to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the other servants had left the room, the man said, "I am the
      groom, sir, that was sent, just before you went to France, with a letter
      to Annaly: there was an answer to that letter, sir, though you never got
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was an answer!" cried Ormond, anger flashing, but an instant
      afterwards joy sparkling in his eyes. "There was a letter!&mdash;From
      whom?&mdash;I'll forgive you all, if you will tell me the whole truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will&mdash;and not a word of lie, and I beg your honour's pardon, if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on&mdash;straight to the fact, this instant, or you shall never have
      my pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why then I stopped to take a glass coming home; and, not knowing how it
      was, I had the misfortune to lose the bit of a note, and I thought no more
      about it till, plase your honour, after you was gone, it was found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found!" cried Ormond, stepping hastily up to him&mdash;"where is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it safe here," said the man, opening a sort of pocket-book "here I
      have kept it safe till your honour came back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond saw and seized upon a letter in Lady Armaly's hand, directed to
      him. Tore it open&mdash;two notes&mdash;one from Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgive you!" said he to the man, and made a sign to him to leave the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ormond had read, or without reading had taken in, by one glance of
      the eye, the sense of the letters&mdash;he rang the bell instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inquire at the post-office," said he to his servant, "whether Lady Annaly
      is in England or Ireland?&mdash;If in England, where?&mdash;if in Ireland,
      whether at Annaly or at Herbert's Town? Quick&mdash;an answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      An answer was quickly brought, "In England&mdash;in Devonshire, sir: here
      is the exact direction to the place, sir. I shall pack up, I suppose,
      sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving a few lines of explanation and affection for Dr. Cambray, our
      young hero was <i>off again</i>, to the surprise and regret of all who saw
      him driving away as fast as horses could carry him. His servant, from the
      box, however, spread as he went, for the comfort of the deploring village,
      the assurance that "Master and he would soon be back again, please Heaven!&mdash;and
      happier than ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that he is safe in the carriage, what was in that note of Miss
      Annaly's which has produced such a <i>sensation</i>? No talismanic charm
      ever operated with more magical celerity than this note. What were the
      words of the charm?
    </p>
    <p>
      That is a secret which shall never be known to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only point which it much imports the public to know is probably
      already guessed&mdash;that the letter did not contain a refusal, nor any
      absolute discouragement of Ormond's hopes. But Lady Annaly and Florence
      had both distinctly told him that they could not receive him at Annaly
      till after a certain day, on which they said that they should be
      particularly engaged. They told him that Colonel Albemarle was at Annaly&mdash;that
      he would leave it at such a time&mdash;and they requested that Mr. Ormond
      would postpone his visit till after that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not receiving this notice, Ormond had unfortunately gone upon the day that
      was specially prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the kneeling figure appeared to him as a rival in despair, not in
      triumph, Ormond asked himself how he could ever have been such an idiot as
      to doubt Florence Annaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did I set off in such haste for Paris?&mdash;Could not I have waited
      a day?&mdash;Could not I have written again?&mdash;Could I not have
      cross-questioned the drunken servant when he was sober?&mdash;Could not I
      have done any thing, in short, but what I did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly as a man, when his anger is dissipated, sees what he ought to have
      done or to have left undone while the fury lasted; vividly as a man in a
      different kind of passion sees the folly of all he did, said, or thought,
      when he was possessed by the past madness; so clearly, so vividly, did
      Ormond now see and feel&mdash;and vehemently execrate, his jealous folly
      and mad precipitation; and then he came to the question, could his folly
      be repaired?&mdash;would his madness ever be forgiven? Ormond, in love
      affairs, never had any presumption&mdash;any tinge of the Connal coxcombry
      in his nature: he was not apt to flatter himself that he had made a deep
      impression; and now he was, perhaps from his sense of the superior value
      of the object, more than usually diffident. Though Miss Annaly was still
      unmarried, she might have resolved irrevocably against him. Though she was
      not a girl to act in the high-flown heroine style, and, in a fit of pride
      or revenge, to punish the man she liked, by marrying his rival, whom she
      did not like; yet Florence Annaly, as Ormond well knew, inherited some of
      her mother's strength of character; and, in circumstances that deeply
      touched her heart, might be capable of all her mother's warmth of
      indignation. It was in her character decidedly to refuse to connect
      herself with any man, however her heart might incline towards him, if he
      had any essential defect of temper; or if she thought that his attachment
      to her was not steady and strong, such as she deserved it should be, and
      such as her sensibility and all her hopes of domestic happiness required
      in a husband. And then there was Lady Annaly to be considered&mdash;how
      indignant she would be at his conduct!
    </p>
    <p>
      While Ormond was travelling alone, he had full leisure to torment himself
      with these thoughts. Pressed forward alternately by hope and fear, each
      urging expedition, he hastened on&mdash;reached Dublin&mdash;crossed the
      water&mdash;and travelling day and night, lost not a moment till he was at
      the feet of his fair mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who like to know the how, the when, and the where, it should be
      told that it was evening when he arrived. Florence Annaly was walking with
      her mother by the seaside, in one of the most beautiful and retired parts
      of the coasts of Devonshire, when they were told by a servant that a
      gentleman from Ireland had just arrived at their house, and wished to see
      them. A minute afterwards they saw&mdash;"Could it be?" Lady Annaly said,
      turning in doubt to her daughter; but the cheek of Florence instantly
      convinced the mother that it could be none but Mr. Ormond himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ormond!" said Lady Annaly, advancing kindly, yet with dignified
      reserve&mdash;"Mr. Ormond, after his long absence, is welcome to his old
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in Ormond's look and manner, as he approached, something that
      much inclined the daughter to hope that he might prove not utterly
      unworthy of her mother's forgiveness; and when he spoke to the daughter,
      there was in his voice and look something that softened the mother's
      heart, and irresistibly inclined her to wish that he might be able to give
      a satisfactory explanation of his strange conduct. Where the parties are
      thus happily disposed both to hear reason, to excuse passion, and to
      pardon the errors to which passion, even in the most reasonable minds, is
      liable, explanations are seldom tedious, or difficult to be comprehended.
      The moment Ormond produced the cover, the soiled cover of the letters, a
      glimpse of the truth struck Florence Annaly; and before he had got farther
      in his sentence than these words, "I did not receive your ladyship's
      letter till within these few days," all the reserve of Lady Annaly's
      manner was dispelled: her smiles relieved his apprehensions, and
      encouraged him to proceed in his story with happy fluency. The
      carelessness of the drunken servant, who had occasioned so much mischief,
      was talked of for a few minutes with great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond took his own share of the blame so frankly and with so good a
      grace, and described with such truth the agony he had been thrown into by
      the sight of the kneeling figure in regimentals, that Lady Annaly could
      not help comforting him by the assurance that Florence had, at the same
      moment, been <i>sufficiently</i> alarmed by the rearing of his horse at
      the sight of the flapping window-blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The kneeling gentleman," said Lady Annaly, "whom you thought at the
      height of joy and glory, was at that moment in the depths of despair. So
      ill do the passions see what is even before their eyes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If Lady Annaly had had a mind to moralize, she might have done so to any
      length, without fear of interruption from either of her auditors, and with
      the most perfect certainty of unqualified submission and dignified
      humility on the part of our hero, who was too happy at this moment not to
      be ready to acknowledge himself to have been wrong and absurd, and worthy
      of any quantity of reprehension or indignation that could have been
      bestowed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship went, however, as far from morality as possible&mdash;to
      Paris. She spoke of the success Mr. Ormond had had in Parisian society&mdash;she
      spoke of M. and Madame de Connal, and various persons with whom he had
      been intimate, among others of the Abb Morellet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond rejoiced to find that Lady Annaly knew he had been in the Abb
      Morellet's distinguished society. The happiest hopes for the future rose
      in his mind, from perceiving that her ladyship, by whatever means, knew
      all that he had been doing in Paris. It seems that they had had accounts
      of him from several English travellers, who had met him at Paris, and had
      heard him spoken of in different companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ormond took care&mdash;give him credit for it all who have ever been in
      love&mdash;even in these first moments, with the object of his present
      affection, Ormond took care to do justice to the absent Dora, whom he now
      never expected to see again. He seized, dexterously, an opportunity, in
      reply to something Lady Annaly said about the Connals, to observe that
      Madame de Connal was not only much admired for her beauty at Paris, but
      that she did honour to Ireland by having preserved her reputation; young,
      and without a guide, as she was, in dissipated French society, with few
      examples of conjugal virtues to preserve in her mind the precepts and
      habits of her British education.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad of this opportunity to give, as he now did with all the energy
      of truth, the result of his feelings and reflections on what he had seen
      of the modes of living among the French; their superior pleasures of
      society, and their want of our domestic happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Ormond was speaking, both the mother and daughter could not help
      admiring, in the midst of his moralizing, the great improvement which had
      been made in his appearance and manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his own characteristic frankness, he acknowledged the impression
      which French gaiety and the brilliancy of Parisian society had at first
      made upon him: he was glad, however, that he had now seen all that the
      imagination often paints as far more delightful than it really is. He had,
      thank Heaven, passed through this course of dissipation without losing his
      taste for better and happier modes of life. The last few months, though
      they might seem but a splendid or feverish dream in his existence, had in
      reality been, he believed, of essential service in confirming his
      principles, settling his character, and deciding for ever his taste and
      judgment, after full opportunity of comparison, in favour of his own
      country&mdash;and especially of his own countrywomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Annaly smiled benignantly, and after observing that this seemingly
      unlucky excursion, which had begun in anger, had ended advantageously to
      Mr. Ormond; and after having congratulated him upon having saved his
      fortune, and established his character solidly, she left him to plead his
      own cause with her daughter&mdash;in her heart cordially wishing him
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he said, or what Florence answered, we do not know; but we are
      perfectly sure that if we did, the repetition of it would tire the reader.
      Lady Annaly and tea waited for them with great patience to an unusually
      late, which they conceived to be an unusually early, hour. The result of
      this conversation was, that Ormond remained with them in this beautiful
      retirement in Devonshire the next day, and the next, and&mdash;how many
      days are not precisely recorded; a blank was left for the number, which
      the editor of these memoirs does not dare to fill up at random, lest some
      Mrs. M'Crule should exclaim, "Scandalously too long to keep the young man
      there!"&mdash;or, "Scandalously too short a courtship, after all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is humbly requested that every young lady of delicacy and feeling will
      put herself in the place of Florence Annaly&mdash;then, imagining the man
      she most approves of to be in the place of Mr. Ormond, she will be pleased
      to fill up the blank with what number of days she may think proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the happy day was named, it was agreed that they should return to
      Ireland, to Annaly; and that their kind friend, Dr. Cambray, should be the
      person to complete that union which he had so long foreseen and so
      anxiously desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who wish to hear something of estates, as well as of weddings,
      should be told that about the same time Ormond received letters from
      Marcus O'Shane, and from M. de Connal; Marcus informing him that the
      estate of Castle Hermitage was to be sold by the commissioners of
      bankrupts, and beseeching him to bid for it, that it might not be sold
      under value. M. de Connal also besought his dear friend, Mr. Ormond to
      take the Black Islands off his hands, for they encumbered him terribly. No
      wonder, living, as he did, at Paris, with his head at Versailles, and his
      heart in a faro bank. Ormond could not oblige both the gentlemen, though
      they had each pressing reasons for getting rid speedily of their property,
      and were assured that he would be the most agreeable purchaser. Castle
      Hermitage was the finest estate, and by far the best bargain. But other
      considerations weighed with our hero. While Sir Ulick O'Shane's son and
      natural representative was living, banished by debts from his native
      country, Ormond could not bear to take possession of Castle Hermitage. For
      the Black Islands he had a fondness&mdash;they were associated with all
      the tender recollections of his generous benefactor. He should hurt no
      one's feelings by this purchase&mdash;and he might do a great deal of
      good, by carrying on his old friend's improvements, and by farther
      civilizing the people of the Islands, all of whom were warmly attached to
      him. They considered Prince Harry as the lawful representative of their
      dear King Corny, and actually offered up prayers for his coming again to
      <i>reign</i> over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who think that the mind is a kingdom of yet more consequence than
      even that of the Black Islands, it may be agreeable to hear that Ormond
      continued to enjoy the empire which he had gained over himself; and to
      maintain that high character, which in spite of his neglected education,
      and of all the adverse circumstances to which he was early exposed, he had
      formed for himself by resolute energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Annaly with the pride of affection, gloried in the full
      accomplishment of her prophecies; and was rewarded in the best manner for
      that benevolent interest which she had early taken in our hero's
      improvement, by seeing the perfect felicity that subsisted between her
      daughter and Ormond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The End.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
