description: "Harrington is an 1817 novel by British novelist Maria Edgeworth. The\
  \ novel was written in response to a letter from a Jewish-American reader who complained\
  \ about Edgeworth's stereotypically anti-semitic portrayals of Jews in Castle Rackrent\
  \ (1800), Belinda (1801), The Absentee (1812), and her Moral Tales (1801) for children.\
  \ The novel is an autobiography of a \"recovering anti-Semite\", whose youthful\
  \ prejudices are undone by contact with various Jewish characters, particularly\
  \ a young woman. It also makes parallels between the religious discrimination of\
  \ the Jews and the Catholics in Ireland. Set between the Jewish Naturalization Act\
  \ of 1753 and the Gordon Riots of 1780, the timeframe highlights these connections.\n\
